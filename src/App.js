THE MULTI-DISCIPLINARY WORK PROPOSED HERE INTEGRATES REMOTE-SENSING, FIELD-BASED, AND SOCIOLOGICAL APPROACHES TO ADDRESS ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE AND SOCIO-ECOLOGICAL IMPACTS IN THE Y-K DELTA REGION. NOTABLY, ALL PHASES OF THE PROJECT WILL BE INFORMED BY QUANTITATIVE, REPEAT SAMPLING OF VEGETATION, SOIL, HYDROLOGY, AND PERMAFROST PROPERTIES ACROSS A LONG-TERM MONITORING PLOT NETWORK THAT WAS ESTABLISHED IN THE MID-1990S AND IS WELL-SUITED FOR VALIDATING MULTI-TEMPORAL REMOTE-SENSING DATASETS. SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES ARE TO (1) ELUCIDATE LINKS BETWEEN THE PRODUCTIVITY OF Y-K DELTA ECOSYSTEMS AND REGIONAL-SCALE ATMOSPHERIC AND CRYOSPHERIC CLIMATE DRIVERS; (2) RESOLVE THE SPATIAL EXTENT AND DRIVERS OF LONG-TERM CHANGES IN VEGETATION AND PHYSICAL LANDSCAPE PROPERTIES RELATED TO LANDSCAPE-SCALE DISTURBANCE PROCESSES; (3) CHARACTERIZE CHANGES IN THE COMPOSITION AND STRUCTURE OF TUNDRA VEGETATION ACROSS A NETWORK OF LONG-TERM MONITORING PLOTS; AND (4) RELATE THE OBSERVED CHANGES TO LOCAL OBSERVATIONS AND CONCERNS REGARDING ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE, IMPACTS TO ECOSYSTEM SERVICES, AND COMMUNITY SUSTAINABILITY. THE PROPOSED WORK WILL OCCUR IN THREE PHASES OVER FOUR YEARS. IN 2015, RESEARCH ACTIVITIES WILL FOCUS ON ANALYSIS OF MULTI-DECADAL REMOTE-SENSING DATA TIME-SERIES, AND RETROSPECTIVE STUDIES OF HISTORICAL AND CONTEMPORARY HIGH-RESOLUTION IMAGERY. RESULTS OF THE REMOTE-SENSING ANALYSIS WILL BE USED TO DESIGN AND IMPLEMENT A GROUND-BASED DATA COLLECTION EFFORT FOCUSED ON VEGETATION, SOILS, HYDROLOGY, AND PERMAFROST ACROSS ENVIRONMENTAL GRADIENTS NEAR TWO YUPIK POPULATION CENTERS: THE CENTRAL COAST REGION NEAR CHEVAK AND THE YUKON DELTA NEAR EMMONAK. IN 2018, WORK WILL FOCUS ON APPLYING FINDINGS TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS AND NEEDS FOR INFORMATION IDENTIFIED BY STAKEHOLDERS AND LAND MANAGERS. THE PROJECT WILL LEVERAGE DETAILED LONG-TERM FIELD DATASETS, AS WELL AS DATA PRODUCTS GENERATED FROM RECENTLY-COMPLETED VEGETATION MAPPING AND REMOTE-SENSING ANALYSIS EFFORTS IN WESTERN ALASKA."

THE DEVICE UTILIZES TWO-PHASE HEAT TRANSFER AND NOVEL GEOMETRIC FEATURES THAT ADAPTIVELY (AND REVERSIBLY) ADJUST THE VIEW FACTOR IN RESPONSE TO INTERNAL PRESSURE IN THE RADIATOR. THE RADIATOR FOLDS INTO A CLOSED SHAPE TO MINIMIZE THE VIEW FACTOR WHEN COLD, AND OPENS UP TO MAXIMIZE THE VIEW FACTOR WHEN HEATED. PROTOTYPES DEMONSTRATED IN PHASE I PROVE THE FEASIBILITY AND HIGHLIGHT THE ADVANTAGES OF A TWO-PHASE RADIATOR OVER SHAPE MEMORY ALLOY TECHNOLOGIES. STRUCTURAL AND THERMAL SIMULATION STUDIES CONFIRMED THE VIABILITY OF THE CONCEPT. AT LOW TEMPERATURES, THE VIEW FACTOR OF EMISSIVE SURFACES OF THE RADIATOR TO THE HEAT SINK IS NEAR ZERO, SO THE ONLY HEAT LOST IS THAT WHICH IS EMITTED FROM THE INSULATED OUTER SURFACES OF THE RADIATOR. THE FLEXIBLE SECTION OF THE RADIATOR IS AN ELASTIC ENVELOPE ENCLOSING A SATURATED WORKING FLUID. WHEN THE TEMPERATURE OF THE RADIATOR INCREASES, THE CORRESPONDING INCREASE IN VAPOR PRESSURE GENERATES A NET FORCE ON THE INTERIOR WALLS OF THE ENVELOPE WHICH CAUSES THE ELASTIC WALLS TO BEND SO THAT THE STRUCTURE OPENS AND THE VIEW FACTOR INCREASES. THE INCREASE IN VIEW FACTOR REDUCES THERMAL RESISTANCE OF HEAT REJECTION WHICH ENABLES INHERENTLY PASSIVE THERMAL CONTROL. ADDITIONALLY, THE ENTIRE STRUCTURE OF THE RADIATOR CONSISTS OF CAVITIES FILLED WITH SATURATED FLUID ACTING LIKE HEAT PIPES, SO THE RADIATING SURFACE WILL BE NEARLY ISOTHERMAL, ACHIEVING A RADIATOR PANEL EFFICIENCY NEAR ONE. IN PHASE I, MODELING AND PROTOTYPING INDICATES THAT THE BASELINE GEOMETRY PROPOSED CAN ACHIEVE A THERMAL TURNDOWN RATIO OF 37:1."

THESE HYBRID WICKS CAN OPERATE AT HIGHER HEAT FLUXES, ALLOWING THE USE OF HIGHER POWER LASER DIODES. THEY ALSO ALLOW THE USE OF VARIABLE CONDUCTANCE HEAT PIPES (VCHPS) IN LUNAR AND MARTIAN LANDERS AND ROVERS, WHICH MUST OPERATE AT TILTS UP TO 45   . CONVENTIONAL ALUMINUM/AMMONIA HEAT PIPES CAN ONLY OPERATE WITH A 0.1 INCH TILT, SO THEY ARE UNSUITABLE.

THIS PROPOSAL ADDRESSES THE FABRICATION OF STRUCTURED (MONOLITHIC), CARBON-BASED TRACE-CONTAMINANT (TC) SORBENTS FOR THE SPACE SUIT USED IN EXTRAVEHICULAR ACTIVITIES (EVAS). THE PROPOSED INNOVATIONS ARE: (1) THE USE OF THIN-WALLED, STRUCTURED CARBON TC SORBENTS FABRICATED USING THREE-DIMENSIONAL (3D) PRINTING; AND (2) THE PATENTED LOW-TEMPERATURE OXIDATION STEP USED FOR THE TREATMENT OF CARBONS DERIVED FROM POLYMERS COMPATIBLE WITH 3D PRINTING. THE OVERALL OBJECTIVE IS TO DEVELOP A TRACE-CONTAMINANT REMOVAL SYSTEM THAT IS RAPIDLY VACUUM-REGENERABLE AND THAT POSSESSES SUBSTANTIAL WEIGHT, SIZE, AND POWER-REQUIREMENT ADVANTAGES WITH RESPECT TO THE CURRENT STATE OF THE ART. THE PHASE 1 PROJECT SUCCESSFULLY DEMONSTRATED 3D-PRINTING OF POLYMER PRECURSORS, ALONG WITH CARBONIZATION AND ACTIVATION TO PRODUCE MONOLITHS WITH EXCELLENT SHAPE, DIMENSIONAL AND AMMONIA ADSORPTION/DESORPTION PROPERTIES. THE PHASE 2 OBJECTIVES ARE: (1) TO OPTIMIZE SORBENT PROPERTIES AND PERFORMANCE; (2) TO DESIGN, CONSTRUCT, TEST, AND DELIVER TWO FULL-SCALE TC SORBENT PROTOTYPES; TO PROVIDE GUIDELINES FOR THEIR INTEGRATION WITH THE PLSS. THIS WORK WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED IN SIX TASKS: (1) SORBENT DEVELOPMENT AND OPTIMIZATION; (2) SUBSCALE SORBENT TESTING AT UTC AEROSPACE SYSTEMS; (3) PROTOTYPE DESIGN; (4) PROTOTYPE CONSTRUCTION; (5) PROTOTYPE TESTING; AND (6) SYSTEM EVALUATION."

THE PHASE I PROJECT DEMONSTRATED THAT MILD HEATING (200-250 C) WAS ADEQUATE FOR TORREFACTION OF A FECAL SIMULANT AND OTHER ANALOGS OF HUMAN SOLID WASTE (CANINE FECES). THE NET RESULT WAS A NEARLY UNDETECTABLE ODOR, COMPLETE RECOVERY OF MOISTURE, SOME ADDITIONAL WATER PRODUCTION, A MODEST REDUCTION OF THE DRY SOLID MASS AND THE PRODUCTION OF SMALL AMOUNTS OF GAS (MAINLY CO2) AND LIQUID (MAINLY WATER). THE AMOUNT OF SOLID VS GAS PLUS LIQUID PRODUCTS CAN BE CONTROLLED BY ADJUSTING THE TORREFACTION CONDITIONS (FINAL TEMPERATURE, HOLDING TIME). THE SOLID PRODUCT WAS A DRY MATERIAL THAT DID NOT SUPPORT MICROBIAL GROWTH AND WAS HYDROPHOBIC RELATIVE TO THE STARTING MATERIAL. IN THE CASE OF CANINE FECES, THE SOLID PRODUCT WAS A MECHANICALLY FRIABLE MATERIAL THAT COULD BE EASILY COMPACTED TO A SIGNIFICANTLY SMALLER VOLUME (#tilde#50%). IN ADDITION, THE TORREFACTION METHOD CAN BE APPLIED USING THE SAME OR SIMILAR CONDITIONS TO OTHER TYPES OF WET SOLID WASTES AND IS COMPATIBLE WITH THE UNIVERSAL WASTE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (UWMS), NOW UNDER DEVELOPMENT BY NASA. THE TORREFACTION PROCESS COULD ALSO BE ACCOMPLISHED WITH MINIMAL CREW INTERACTIONS AND MODEST ENERGY REQUIREMENTS, WHICH COULD BE IMPROVED EVEN FURTHER IN AN OPTIMIZED AND INNOVATIVE PHASE II TORREFACTION PROCESSING UNIT (TPU), WHICH IS THE OBJECTIVE OF THE CURRENT PROPOSAL."

KNOWLEDGE OF THE CONCENTRATION AND SIZE OF AIRBORNE PARTICLES ON MANNED SPACECRAFT IS NEEDED TO ASSESS ENVIRONMENT TO WHICH ASTRONAUTS ARE EXPOSED, AND TO PROVIDE EARLY WARNING OF ON-BOARD FIRE. ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT ARE THOSE IN THE SUBMICROMETER SIZE RANGE. YET TO DATE THERE IS NO ZERO-GRAVITY TECHNIQUE FOR LONG-TERM MONITORING THESE FINE PARTICLES AT THE LOW CONCENTRATIONS GENERALLY PRESENT. OUR INNOVATION, A TIPPABLE, SELF-SUSTAINING, WATER-BASED CONDENSATION PARTICLE COUNTER, WILL PROVIDE THIS MEASUREMENT.

THE PROPOSED INNOVATION SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCES THE CONTROL COMPLEXITY OF PHASED ARRAYS BY REDUCING THE CONTROL SET FROM MXN PHASE CONTROLS TO M+N PHASE CONTROLS WHERE M AND N REPRESENT THE NUMBER OF ROWS AND COLUMNS IN THE PHASED ARRAY. BY REDUCING THE CONTROL COMPLEXITY, NOT ONLY ARE THE PHASED ARRAY DEVICES SIMPLIFIED, BUT THE CONTROL DISTRIBUTION NETWORK IS SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCED. THIS SIMPLIFICATION RIPPLES ACROSS THE ENTIRE PHASED ARRAY TO IMPROVE PHYSICAL INTEGRATION AND THERMAL MANAGEMENT WHICH OFTEN COST AS MUCH AS THE PHASED ARRAY COMPONENTS. THIS IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT FOR HIGH FREQUENCY ANTENNAS WHERE UNIT CELL SIZES BECOME A SIGNIFICANT IMPEDIMENT TO SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION. THIS PROPOSAL SUMMARIZES THE PHASE I SBIR FINDINGS DEFINITIVELY DEMONSTRATING THE PHASED ARRAY INNOVATION FEASIBILITY AND APPLICABILITY TO FUTURE NASA KA BAND COMMUNICATIONS AND SENSORS. THIS PHASED ARRAY TECHNOLOGY DOES NOT RELY ON FUTURE ADVANCEMENTS IN DEVICE TECHNOLOGY AND CONTROLS BUT IS REALIZABLE USING PROVEN, INHERENTLY RADIATION HARDENED MMIC DEVICE TECHNOLOGY WIDELY AVAILABLE TODAY.

      "description": "NASA IS LOOKING FOR SOLUTIONS FOR ITS LONG-TERM OR DISTANCE FOOD STORAGE AND TRANSPORT APPLICATIONS. ACHIEVING HIGH THERMAL EFFICIENCIES AND RELIABILITY WHILE MAINTAINING VOLUMETRIC AND MASS EFFICIENCY HAS BEEN THE KEY CHALLENGE WITH THESE KINDS OF REFRIGERATION/FREEZING SYSTEMS IN A MICROGRAVITY ENVIRONMENT. PREVIOUS STATE OF THE ART REFRIGERATOR/FREEZER SYSTEMS SUCH AS THE ISS RFR, USE THERMOELECTRIC THERMAL CONTROL WITH VERY LOW OVERALL SYSTEM COP OF AROUND 0.36 (IN FREEZER MODE). ALTERNATIVELY, TERRESTRIAL COLD FOOD STORAGE SYSTEMS UTILIZE MUCH MORE EFFICIENT VAPOR COMPRESSION THERMAL CONTROL SYSTEMS, MAKING THE SYSTEMS LIGHTER AND MORE COMPACT. CURRENTLY, THESE SYSTEMS DO NOT HAVE PROVISIONS TO FULFILL THE LOAD AND RELIABILITY REQUIREMENTS OF SPACE APPLICATIONS AND ARE ALSO NOT DESIGNED FOR MICROGRAVITY OPERATION. AN EXAMPLE WOULD BE KELVINATOR KCCF220QW CHEST FREEZER. THIS FREEZER CAN MAINTAIN TEMPERATURES AS LOW AS 26 C AT COPS OF AROUND 2.2 TO 2.4. AIR SQUARED IS PROPOSING THE DEVELOPMENT OF A ZERO-GRAVITY VAPOR COMPRESSION REFRIGERATOR (ZVCR). THE ZVCR IS AN OIL-FREE, SCROLL DRIVEN, VAPOR COMPRESSION FOOD STORAGE SYSTEM THAT IS THERMALLY EFFICIENT, LIGHTWEIGHT AND RELIABLE. SIMILAR TO CONVENTIONAL SYSTEMS, THE ZVCR WILL INCLUDE FOUR MAJOR COMPONENTS: COMPRESSOR, CONDENSER, EXPANSION DEVICE AND EVAPORATOR. BUT, INSTEAD OF A HEAVY AND OIL LUBRICATED WORKING FLUID COMPRESSOR, IT WILL USE AN ADVANCED OIL-FREE ORBITING TYPE SCROLL COMPRESSOR AND EXPANDER DEVELOPED BY AIR SQUARED. ITS OIL-FREE DESIGN WILL REMOVE SYSTEM S OPERATIONAL RELIANCE ON GRAVITY WHILE KEEPING THE DESIGN COMPACT&LIGHTWEIGHT AT HIGHER EFFICIENCIES. FOR EXPANSION WORK RECOVERY, A SCROLL EXPANDER BASED ON THE SAME TECHNOLOGY AS THE COMPRESSOR WILL BE USED TO FURTHER IMPROVE THE SYSTEM S PERFORMANCE. CUSTOM HEAT EXCHANGERS WILL BE DESIGNED FOR EFFICIENT OPERATION IN MICROGRAVITY WHILE CONSIDERING THE SIZE, WEIGHT AND RELIABILITY REQUIREMENTS."

      "description": "THE PROPOSED INNOVATION IS THE WORLD''S FIRST CRYOGENIC SPINNING SCROLL PUMP (CSSP) CAPABLE OF PUMPING LIQUID METHANE OR OXYGEN AT FLOWS OF 8-10 LBM/S. THE PRIMARY GOAL IS TO DEVELOP A VERSATILE PROOF OF CONCEPT CSSP, CAPABLE OF PUMPING LIQUID OR TWO-PHASE METHANE OR OXYGEN AT A WIDE RANGE OF SPEEDS (I.E. 1,000-8,000 RPM) AND A WIDE RANGE OF DIFFERENTIAL PRESSURES WHILE MAINTAINING HIGH-RELIABILITY AND A COMPACT SIZE. THE PUMP WILL BE CONFIGURABLE, TO ALLOW MULTIPLE PUMPS TO BE PLACED IN SERIES FOR HIGH-PRESSURE MULTI-STAGE OPERATION. DURING PHASE I, AIR SQUARED SUCCESSFULLY DESIGNED, FABRICATED AND TESTED A PROTOTYPE CSSP ON LIQUID NITROGEN. FOR CRYOGENIC PUMPING, STATE OF THE ART (SOA), CONSISTS OF TWO VASTLY DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGY OPTIONS. CENTRIFUGAL TURBOPUMPS AND POSITIVE DISPLACEMENT PUMPS. TURBOPUMPS UTILIZE AN IMPELLER-INDUCER COMBINATION THAT RELIES ON HIGH IMPELLER SPEEDS TO CREATE A DIFFERENTIAL PRESSURE. WHILE THE HIGH-SPEED OPERATION MAKES TURBOPUMPS COMPACT, IT ALSO LIMITS BEARING LIFE, DIFFERENTIAL PRESSURE, AND THEY CAN''T HANDLE TWO-PHASE FLOW. POSITIVE DISPLACEMENT PUMPS CAN HANDLE LARGER PRESSURE DIFFERENTIALS AND DON''T HAVE ISSUES WITH TWO-PHASE FLOW. HOWEVER, THEY CAN''T ACHIEVE SPEEDS OVER 3,000 RPM WITHOUT BULKY AND HIGH-LOAD BEARINGS MAKING THEM LESS DESIRABLE FOR AEROSPACE APPLICATIONS. THE CSSP OFFERS THE BEST OF BOTH OPTIONS. AS A POSITIVE DISPLACEMENT PUMP, IT CAN ACHIEVE HIGH-PRESSURES WITH MINIMAL REDUCTION IN FLOW AND PUMP SATURATED LIQUIDS AT LOW NET-POSITIVE SUCTION HEADS. DUE TO THE SPINNING MOTION OF THE PUMP, VARIOUS CENTRIFUGAL LOADS ARE ELIMINATED ALLOWING SPEEDS OVER 8,000 RPM POSSIBLE AND MAKING THE DESIGN COMPACT AND LIGHTWEIGHT. ADDITIONALLY, THE SPINNING MOTION OF THE SCROLLS ELIMINATES THE NEED FOR A COUNTERBALANCE COMMON IN ORBITING SCROLL DESIGNS. THIS FURTHER REDUCES WEIGHT BY ELIMINATING COUNTERWEIGHTS AND EASES BEARING LOADS. AIR SQUARED BELIEVES THE PROPOSED CSSP IS A PERFECT FIT IN SUPPORT OF METHANE IN-SPACE PROPULSION."

      "description": "IGF::OT::IGF  AIR-LOCK''S PHASE I EFFORT TESTED THE EFFECTS OF BALL INDUCED CONTACT STRESSES ON TITANIUM BEARING RACES. THE CONTACT STRESS DESIGN LIMIT THAT WOULD ACHIEVE A PLANETARY EXPLORATION SUITS REQUIRED CYCLE LIFE WAS DETERMINED. THESE TESTS WERE PERFORMED ON UNIFORMLY LOADED FLAT THRUST BEARING STYLE TEST PLATES. THE PHASE II EFFORT WILL TAKE THIS INFORMATION AND USE IT IN A REAL WORLD APPLICATION, EXISTING ADVANCED PLANETARY EXPLORATION SUITS BEARINGS. SPECIFICALLY FOCUSING ON THE Z-1 SERIES SUITS HIP AND WAIST, AND ALSO THE Z-2 SERIES HIP BEARINGS. THESE ARE AREAS THAT ARE KNOWN TO HAVE LARGE CONTACT STRESSES DUE TO NON-UNIFORM LOADING THROUGH AXIAL RESTRAINT LINES. THIS LOADING YIELDS INCREASED STRESSES IN DIFFERENT AREAS OF THE RACE. WITH AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE MAX EXPECTED STRESS, THE BEARING DESIGN CAN BE MADE TO ACCOMMODATE ALL CONTACT STRESSES APPLIED TO THE RACE. THE PHASE II EFFORT WILL CONSIST OF FINDING THE MAXIMUM EXPECTED CONTACT STRESSES IN THESE BEARINGS THROUGH BOTH TEST AND FEA SIMULATION. THE BEARING DESIGNS CAN THEN BE OPTIMIZED TO REDUCE THE CONTACT STRESSES IN THESE AREAS. AIR-LOCK WILL MANUFACTURE DVT UNITS IN ORDER TO CYCLE TEST THE OPTIMIZED BEARINGS. THE TASK WILL BE FINALIZED WITH THE DELIVERY OF OPTIMIZED BEARINGS CAPABLE OF BEING USED ON THE Z-1 SERIES AND Z-2 SERIES SUITS."

THE VERY SUCCESSFUL NASA LED X-43A HYPERSONIC FLIGHT PROVED THE ABILITY TO USE STATE OF THE ART (SOTA) 2D C-C WITH OXIDATION COATING SYSTEM. HOWEVER, CURRENT MATERIAL SYSTEMS CAN ONLY OFFER LIMITED TEMPERATURE CAPABILITY (<3000  F) AND MOSTLY FOR SINGLE USE APPLICATION. IN PHASE I, TWO INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES, UNDERCOAT AND FGM MULTI-LAYER COATS, WERE DEVELOPED AND SCREENED. THEY WERE FURTHER INTEGRATED INTO TWO SOTA C-C COMPOSITES. OXIDATION PROTECTED C-C SAMPLES WERE TORCH TESTED AT 3500 F/ 30 MINUTES, AT 4200 F/ 2 MINUTES UP TO 10 CYCLES, AND AT 3000 F/COOL/ 4000 F CYCLES SHOWING VERY PROMISING RESULTS. THE COMBINED EFFECTS OF THE UNDERCOAT AND FGM SPRAY COATS PROVIDE REPEATABLE PERFORMANCE BY CREATING A GLASS FORMING, CONFORMING AND ADHERENT EXTERNAL COATING TO PROTECT THE C-C FROM BEING OXIDIZED. THE OVERALL OBJECTIVE OF THE PROPOSED P-II IS TO FURTHER DEVELOP AND OPTIMIZE A ROBUST, TAILORABLE, AND AFFORDABLE OXIDATION PROTECTION SYSTEM FOR C-C TPS AND C-C HOT STRUCTURE BY INTEGRATING OUR UNDERCOAT AND FGM MULTI-LAYER SPRAY COAT TECHNOLOGIES INTO AT LEAST TWO GRADES C-C COMPOSITES (T300 AND P30 2D C-C) MEETING HIGHER TEMPERATURE PERFORMANCE UP TO 4500 F AND MULTI-USE APPLICATIONS. WORK PLAN INCLUDES 12 TASKS OVER 24 MONTH GROUPED INTO 5 CATEGORIES. ONCE FURTHER OPTIMIZED AND VALIDATED UNDER PHASE II, THESE TECHNOLOGIES CAN EASILY BE INTEGRATED INTO SOTA C-C USING CURRENT MANUFACTURING FACILITIES. THE RESULTING OXIDATION PROTECTED C-C COULD BE TAILORABLE, AFFORDABLE, AND EASILY SCALED UP FOR LARGE COMPONENTS OR STRUCTURE REQUIRED IN FUTURE NASA, DOD AND COMMERCIAL SPACE APPLICATIONS."

      "description": "PRECISION NAVIGATION AND TIMING (PNT) IS A CRITICAL RESOURCE FOR GOVERNMENT AND COMMERCIAL AEROSPACE. GIVEN THE HIGH LAUNCH COST AND SHIFT TOWARD SMALLER PAYLOADS, REDUCING THE SIZE, WEIGHT, AND POWER (SWAP) OF SPACE-BASED NAVIGATION SYSTEMS IS A CRITICAL NEED. ATOM-INTERFEROMETRIC INERTIAL SENSORS HAVE DEMONSTRATED SUPERIOR PERFORMANCE OVER CONVENTIONAL INERTIAL DEVICES OWING TO THE INTRINSIC STABILITY OF ATOMIC SYSTEMS. CENTRAL TO MAKING COLD ATOM SENSORS PRACTICAL IS THEIR ABILITY TO RELIABLY OPERATE FOR EXTENDED PERIODS WITHOUT USER INTERVENTION. CURRENT LASER DIODES, WHICH ARE AT THE HEART OF ATOMIC SENSORS, SUFFER FROM POWER DEGRADATION AND MODE HOPS ON TIMESCALES INCOMPATIBLE WITH LONG TERM DEPLOYMENT. BECAUSE THESE PROPERTIES ARE INHERENT TO THE DIODES, IT IS PRUDENT TO CIRCUMVENT THESE PROBLEMS WITH DIAGNOSTIC PROTOCOLS AIMED AT EARLY DETECTION AND ACTION. DIODES CLOSE TO MODE HOPPING CAN BE TEMPORARILY TAKEN OFFLINE TO TUNE AWAY THE MODE HOP VIA CURRENT AND TEMPERATURE. DIODES WITH DEGRADED POWER CAN BE TAKEN OFFLINE ENTIRELY IN FAVOR OF A HEALTHY DIODE. THIS APPROACH WILL PROVIDE A ROBUST, WAVELENGTH-AGNOSTIC TECHNIQUE TO DELIVER RELIABLE, LONG-LIVED LASER SOURCES AT ATOM SENSOR-RELEVANT WAVELENGTHS. AOSENSE PROPOSES TO DEVELOP A COLD ATOM LASER MODULE (CALM) CAPABLE OF SUPPORTING A BROAD RANGE OF ATOMIC SENSORS. DEVELOPMENT OF THE CALM LASER MODULE WILL RESULT IN A RUGGEDIZED AND RELIABLE LASER SOURCE CAPABLE OF AUTONOMOUSLY DRIVING AN ATOM-BASED SENSOR WITHIN THE SPACE ENVIRONMENT. SUCH AN EFFORT WOULD ENABLE SPACE-BASED APPLICATIONS FOR ATOMIC SENSORS SUCH AS IMUS, CLOCKS, AND MAGNETOMETERS, OPENING UP SIGNIFICANT MARKET OPPORTUNITIES IN THE DEFENSE AND COMMERCIAL SECTORS."

IN PHASE I, WE HAVE DEMONSTRATED THE REQUISITE PERFORMANCE USING EXISTING HARDWARE COUPLED WITH OFF-THE-SHELF CONTROL ELECTRONICS. BASED ON OUR RESULTS, WE HAVE DESIGNED A FULLY-INTEGRATED MODULE CAPABLE OF DISSEMINATING TIMING SIGNALS WITH SUB-FEMTOSECOND ERROR FROM 1-10,000 S. IN PHASE II, WE WILL PACKAGE THE DEVICE AND DELIVER IT FOR EXTERNAL TESTING. OUR SYSTEM IS EXPECTED TO IMPROVE GROUND-TO-SATELLITE SYNCHRONIZATION A MILLION-FOLD OVER CURRENT RF-BASED TIME TRANSFER SYSTEMS, ENABLING APPLICATIONS INCLUDING CLOCK-BASED GEODESY, VERY LONG BASELINE INTERFEROMETRY, COHERENT LIDAR ARRAYS, AND TESTS OF GENERAL RELATIVITY. THE PHASE I BREADBOARD DEMONSTRATION PERFORMANCE IS CONSISTENT WITH A TIMING JITTER OF 3 FS @ 1S AND INTEGRATES DOWN TO 700 AS AT 30 SECONDS. THE CORRESPONDING FRACTIONAL TIMING INSTABILITY IS 3 X 10^-15 @ 1 SECOND, WHICH FLICKERS AT 2.7 X 10^-17 OUT TO 2000 SECONDS. WE HAVE IDENTIFIED THE SYSTEMATIC EFFECTS THAT LIMIT BOTH SHORT AND LONG TERM STABILITY AND INCORPORATED THE IMPROVEMENTS INTO THE PHASE II DESIGN. WITH THESE IMPROVEMENTS, WE EXPECT A 10X IMPROVEMENT IN BOTH SHORT AND LONG TERMS STABILITY OF THE SYSTEM. IN ADDITION, WE REVIEWED AND FORMALIZED THE LASER DRIVER AND CONTROL ELECTRONICS SPECIFICATIONS. THE INITIAL SCHEMATIC CAPTURE FOR CRITICAL ANALOG SUB SECTIONS WAS COMPLETED AND A SUITABLE FPGA/MICROPROCESSOR COMBINATION WAS CHOSEN TO CONTROL THE SYSTEM AND PROCESS THE TIMING INFORMATION. BASED ON THESE DESIGNS, POWER AND SIZE ESTIMATES WERE USED TO COMPLETE THE MECHANICAL ENCLOSURE MODEL FOR THE TIME-TRANSFER SYSTEM. FOR MAXIMUM FLEXIBILITY IN THE FINAL ARCHITECTURE OF THE OVERALL FREE-SPACE TIME TRANSFER SYSTEM, EACH FREQUENCY COMB SUB-UNIT THAT INCLUDES THE LASER AND CONTROL ELECTRONICS WILL BE HOUSED IN A 1U RACK MOUNT ENCLOSURE."

TO ESTIMATE RUNWAY CAPACITY, PARC ANALYZES HISTORICAL DATA DESCRIBING AN AIRPORT S TRAFFIC MOVEMENTS, OPERATING CONDITIONS, OPERATING PROCEDURES, AND GEOSPATIAL DATA TO DETERMINE THE TIME INTERVALS BETWEEN SUCCESSIVE AIRCRAFT USING AN AIRPORT S RUNWAY AND VARIABLES THAT INFLUENCE IT. VARIABLES MAY INCLUDE FACILITY, AIRCRAFT, FLIGHT PLAN AND WEATHER CONDITIONS. SECOND, PARC USES THE DATA TO CONSTRUCT BAYESIAN NETWORK (BN) STATISTICAL MODELS OF THE JOINT PROBABILITY OF INTER-AIRCRAFT TIME SPACING AND THE VARIABLES FOR EACH AIRPORT S RUNWAY. THIRD, PARC PERFORMS MONTE-CARLO SIMULATIONS OF THE TRAFFIC PLANNED TO USE EACH RUNWAY, SAMPLING THE BN MODELS TO ESTIMATE THE SPACING OF SUCCESSIVE TAKEOFF, LANDING AND TAXI CROSSING AIRCRAFT, TO OBTAIN A DISTRIBUTION OF POSSIBLE RUNWAY CAPACITIES. FOURTH, PARC SELECTS A A TARGET RUNWAY CAPACITY FROM THE DISTRIBUTION FOR AIRPORT TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT. THE ADVANTAGES OF PARC ARE ADAPTING TO THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE AIRPORT AND ACCOUNTING FOR THE ANTICIPATED OPERATING CONDITIONS TO PROVIDE ACCURATE ESTIMATES OF RUNWAY CAPACITY. PHASE I DEMONSTRATES PROCESSING OF FAA SYSTEM WIDE INFORMATION MANAGEMENT (SWIM) TRACEABLE DATA SOURCES FOR MODELING FOR 1-YEAR OF DATA FOR ATLANTA-HARTSFIELD INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT (KATL). PHASE I USES THE DATA TO CONSTRUCTS BN MODELS OF INTER-AIRCRAFT TIME SPACING AND TO VALIDATE THE MODELS. PHASE I DEMONSTRATES THE GREATER ACCURACY OF THE BN MODELS IN REPRESENTING AND PREDICTING INTER-AIRCRAFT TIME SPACING THAN A SIMPLER SINGLE-EVENT PROBABILITY MODEL. PHASE I DEMONSTRATES SAMPLING OF THE BN MODELS FOR DIFFERENT AIRPORT, AIRCRAFT AND FLIGHT PLAN CONDITIONS TO OBTAIN INTER-AIRCRAFT SPACING VALUES TO BE USED IN MONTE-CARLO SIMULATIONS FOR CAPACITY PREDICTION."

OUR CHAMBER DESIGN, WHICH IS APPLICABLE TO FUTURE NASA SMALL LAUNCH VEHICLES, EXPLOITS THE COMBINED CAPABILITIES OF SELECTIVE LASER MELTING (SLM) AND MAGNETIC PULSE WELDING (MPW), IN ORDER TO REDUCE MANUFACTURING LEAD TIME AND COST AND TO IMPROVE QUALITY THROUGH EASE OF INSPECTION. THE CHAMBER WILL USE A TWO-PIECE GRCOP-84 LINER THAT IS INSERTED AND MP WELDED INTO A ONE-PIECE INCONEL 625 STRUCTURAL JACKET. THE MPW STEP WILL BE USED TO PERMANENTLY JOIN THE TWO HALVES OF THE LINER AT THE THROAT AND THE LINER ITSELF TO THE JACKET IN A STRUCTURALLY SOUND, WATERTIGHT MANNER. OUR STRUCTURAL JACKET DESIGN INCLUDES INTEGRAL PROPELLANT MANIFOLDS, WHICH ELIMINATES THE TIME AND EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH MACHINING OR CASTING SEPARATE COMPONENTS AND WELDING THEM IN PLACE. THE BENEFITS OF SUCH A DESIGN ARE SUBSTANTIAL. FIRST, IT IS WELL UNDERSTOOD THAT FOR COMPLICATED COMPONENTS LIKE A MODERN COMBUSTION CHAMBER, AN AM MANUFACTURING APPROACH CAN DRASTICALLY REDUCE COST (BY 50% OR MORE) AND LEAD TIME (WEEKS INSTEAD OF MONTHS). SECOND, OUR PARTICULAR DESIGN OVERCOMES WEAKNESSES OF OTHER ADDITIVE DESIGNS BY ENABLING EASY INSPECTION OF THE PRINTED PARTS THAT OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE TO UNDERGO CT SCANNING OR X-RAY INSPECTION, WHICH HAS PROVEN TO BE EXCEPTIONALLY DIFFICULT FOR COMPLEX INTERNAL GEOMETRIES LIKE REGENERATIVE COOLING CHANNELS AND PROPELLANT MANIFOLDS. THIRD, OUR BASIC MATERIAL AND MANUFACTURING APPROACH IS SCALABLE TO BOOSTER CLASS COMBUSTION CHAMBERS AT A RATE CONTROLLED SOLELY BY SCALING OF THE BUILD VOLUMES AVAILABLE IN COMMERCIAL SLM MACHINES (WHICH IS OCCURRING RAPIDLY). IN FACT, COMMERCIAL MPW SYSTEMS ARE ALREADY BEING USED IN THE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY THAT CAN INSTANTANEOUSLY WELD PARTS OF SEVERAL METERS IN LENGTH"

BY VIRTUE OF A CLASS OF REVERSIBLE SOLID-STATE CHEMICAL REACTIONS (CALLED INTERCHAIN TRANSESTERIFICATION REACTIONS - ITR) INTRINSIC TO THE POLYMER, ATSP WAS SHOWN TO BOND AND DEBOND WITH ITSELF FOR>50 CYCLES DURING THE PHASE I WITH HIGH MECHANICAL STRENGTH ALLOWING LOAD VALUES>6 THE REQUIREMENT OF THE SOLICITATION IN AN VERY SMALL CONTACT AREA. IN PHASE II OF THIS PROJECT WE WILL APPLY THIS REVERSIBLE ADHESIVE CONCEPT TO ASSEMBLY AND RECONFIGURATION OF TRUSS STRUCTURES COMPOSED OF TUBULAR BEAMS AND WE WILL DO ELECTRICAL, THERMAL AND MECHANICAL CHARACTERIZATIONS OF THE REVERSIBLY JOINED TUBE SEGMENTS. BASED ON THE REVERSIBLE ADHESION CONCEPT DEVELOPED AND DEMONSTRATED IN PHASE I, A SELF-ALIGNING ATTACHMENT MECHANISM FOR TUBULAR BEAMS AND HUB JOINTS WITH INTEGRATED HEATING IS PROPOSED. DESIGNED ATTACHMENT MECHANISMS AND DEVELOPED PROCESSES WILL BE APPLIED TO ASSEMBLY AND RECONFIGURATION OF TRUSS UNIT CELL. POLYMERIC REVERSIBLE ADHESIVE WILL BE SUBJECTED TO OUTGASSING AND RADIATION EXPERIMENTS (TO DETERMINE APPLICABILITY TO SPACE ENVIRONMENT) IN SIMULATION OF LOW EARTH ORBIT WITH ADDITIONAL BOND/DEBOND CYCLES FOLLOWING RADIATION EXPOSURE IMPLEMENTED VIA A TOOLKIT DEVELOPED IN PHASE I. THE HIGH MECHANICAL STRENGTH PROVIDES DESIGN FLEXIBILITY FOR SPACE IN THE JOINTS FOR ELECTRICAL CONTACTS, THEREBY ALLOWING MULTIFUNCTIONALITY OF THE SPACE STRUCTURES; WITH FULL SCALE DIMENSION OF THE REAL TRUSS STRUCTURE, THE JOINT WOULD BE ABLE TO REACH A BOND STRENGTH OF 56,760N (113 TIMES THE REQUIRED 500N)."

OUR CONCEPT EXPLOITS DOUBLY FED GENERATOR TECHNOLOGY THAT HAS RECEIVED CONSIDERABLE DEVELOPMENT FOR WIND ENERGY APPLICATIONS AND ADAPTS IT TO THE AIRCRAFT ELECTRIC PROPULSOR APPLICATION. IN PARTICULAR, THE WIND APPLICATION IS LOW FREQUENCY, LOW SPEED, 600V, FIXED FREQUENCY, MW CLASS, SLIP-RING OR BRUSHLESS DOUBLY FED GENERATOR TECHNOLOGY. OUR PROPOSED EFFORT ADAPTS THAT TECHNOLOGY TO DEVELOP HIGHER VOLTAGE (1KV), VARIABLE FREQUENCY, HIGH SPEED AIRCRAFT ELECTRIC BRUSHLESS DOUBLY FED MOTORS (BDFM) FOR THE ADVANCED PROPULSOR APPLICATION. IMPORTANT ADVANTAGES OF OUR PROPULSOR TECHNICAL SOLUTION, OUR TEAM AND OUR PROGRAM PLAN ARE: 1. OUR DUAL FED MOTOR CONCEPT IS BRUSHLESS, WHICH WAS IDENTIFIED AS HIGHLY IMPORTANT BY AIRCRAFT OEM/INTEGRATORS WHEN BRIEFED ON OUR APPROACH. 2. OUR BDFM PROPULSOR MOTOR RESULTS IN A 40% REDUCTION IN MASS OF THE PROPULSOR UNIT (MOTOR, CONVERTER, AND GEAR SYSTEM) COMPARED TO OTHER APPROACHES (INCLUDING PERMANENT MAGNET PROPULSORS) AND ALSO INCREASES PROPULSOR UNIT EFFICIENCY BY 4%. 3. OUR BDFM PROPULSOR MOTOR APPROACH IS FEASIBLE AND VIABLE BECAUSE OF ITS ROOTS IN DOUBLY FED GENERATORS FOR WIND ENERGY APPLICATIONS, BUT IT ALSO REPRESENTS AN ADVANCEMENT IN THE STATE OF THE ART FOR BRUSHLESS DOUBLY FED MACHINES AND ADVANCEMENT IN THE STATE-OF-THE-ART FOR ELECTRIC PROPULSOR UNITS. 4. OUR TEAM IS HIGHLY QUALIFIED TO SUCCEED IN OUR PROPOSED EFFORT WITH WORLD CLASS SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS IN THE KEY ASPECTS OF OUR BDFM PROPULSOR MOTOR. 5. OUR COMMERCIALIZATION PLAN AND TRANSITION TO PRODUCTION PLAN SETS THE SEEDS FOR LONG TERM SUCCESS BY BRINGING ON A FUTURE MANUFACTURER AS A STRATEGIC PARTNER DURING OUR PHASE II EFFORT."

THE COMPACT TRANSMITTER WILL INCLUDE A \\\"NANO-SWIFT\\\" THAT WILL HAVE SIZE AND WEIGHT COMPARABLE TO A BUTTERFLYPACKAGED DFB DIODE LASER BUT WITH FAR BETTER FREQUENCY STABILITY AND HIGHER POWER. IN PHASE II WE WILL DEMONSTRATE OUTPUT CHARACTERISTICS OF 32 MJ, 100 HZ PRF, AND 300-500 NS PULSE DURATIONS FROM THIS COMPACT ROBUST INJECTION-SEEDED TRANSMITTER. THIS MODERATE-PRF MODERATE-ENERGY TRANSMITTER WILL BE IMMEDIATELY SUITABLE FOR 3D WINDS FROM GROUND AND AIRBORNE PLATFORMS AND WITH CONTINUED TRL ADVANCEMENT EVENTUALLY SPACE PLATFORMS. THE TRANSMITTER WILL BE CAPABLE OF EFFICIENT OPERATION AT>4 W AVERAGE POWER AT LOWER PULSE ENERGIES AND HIGHER PRFS (E.G.. 1 -4 KHZ) WHICH IS SUITABLE FOR IPDA SPECTROSCOPY AND HARD TARGET MEASUREMENT LIDAR SYSTEMS OPERATING FROM SPACE (FOLLOWING AN APPROPRIATE ENGINEERING AND QUALIFICATION EFFORT) USING EITHER COHERENT OR DIRECT DETECTION WITH STATE-OF-THE-ART LOW-NOISE DIRECT DETECTORS. THE OVERARCHING OBJECTIVE OF THE PROPOSED EFFORT IS TO DEVELOP COMPACT, EFFICIENT, AND RELIABLE PULSED AND CW LASERS AND LIDAR TRANSMITTERS FOR FUTURE NASA MISSIONS. SPECIFICALLY, WE ADDRESS NEEDS DESCRIBED FOR 3D WINDS, ATMOSPHERIC CO2 AND H20 CONCENTRATION SENSING IN THE 2.05 UM REGION; BUT WE ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT SUCH INNOVATIONS CAN BE READILY APPLIED TO TRANSMITTER LASER OPERATION AT OTHER IR AND SWIR WAVELENGTHS AND ASSOCIATED INSTRUMENTS.\""

AUTONOMOUS GNC ALLOWS A SPACECRAFT TO PERFORM MOST OF ITS OWN NAVIGATION ACTIVITIES WITHOUT THE NEED FOR GROUND-BASED PERSONNEL AND DSN TIME, REDUCING COST AND REQUIRED DSN CONTACT TIME, SAVING MONEY, AND ALLOWING SPECIALIZED NAVIGATION PERSONNEL FROM DIFFERENT NASA CENTERS TO BE EASILY SHARED AMONG MISSIONS. AUTONOMOUS GNC ACTIVITIES INCLUDE: -SPACECRAFT POSITIONING ABSOLUTE AND RELATIVE (HELIO, PLANET, SMALL-BODY) RELATIVE TO SMALL BODIES, OTHER SPACECRAFT FOR RENDEZVOUS -ORBIT DETERMINATION -TARGET TRACKING OF BODIES, APERTURES, SPACECRAFT, GROUND-BASED ASSETS -TRAJECTORY DERIVATION -LOW-THRUST MANEUVERING FOR SOLAR ELECTRIC PROPULSION (SEP) -EPHEMERIS CALCULATIONS AUTONAV FROM THE JET PROPULSION LABORATORY IMPLEMENTS THESE FUNCTIONS, AND COMPONENTS HAVE FLOWN ON DEEP SPACE 1 AND DEEP IMPACT. WITH AN APPROPRIATE APPLICATION OF SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS TO REENGINEER THE CODE, A NEW AUTONAV MARK 4 COULD BE MADE AVAILABLE AS A COMMERCIALIZED PRODUCT MEETING NASA CLASS B SOFTWARE STANDARDS, THEREBY ENABLING ITS EASY INCLUSION ON A WIDE VARIETY OF NASA AND NON-NASA MISSIONS. AUTONAV MARK 4 SOURCE CODE IS TO BE DESIGNED AND TESTED TO BE COMPATIBLE WITH A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT CPUS (E.G. SPARC, PPC, INTEL), REAL-TIME OPERATING SYSTEMS (VXWORKS, RTEMS), AND FLIGHT SOFTWARE CORES LIKE NASA CORE FLIGHT SYSTEM.

COMMERCIALIZED ON-BOARD AUTONOMOUS NAVIGATION AS PROVIDED BY AUTONAV MARK 4 CAN BE TARGETED AT THE WHOLE RANGE OF LEO, GEO, AND INTERPLANETARY MISSIONS, LARGE AND SMALL. AUTONAV MARK 4 FOR LOW-THRUST MISSIONS (INCLUDING PSYCHE AND NEXT MARS ORBITER) WOULD ALLOW A DRAMATIC REDUCTION IN NAVIGATION AND TRAJECTORY CALCULATION COSTS BY MOVING THE BULK OF THESE ACTIVITIES ONBOARD. LONG MISSIONS LIKE THESE WOULD INCUR EVEN LARGER SAVINGS USING AN4 THAN MORE MODEST MISSIONS. AUTONAV MARK 4 IS DIRECTLY APPLICABLE TO JPL''S DEEP SPACE POSITIONING SYSTEM. BY USING A COMMERCIALIZED AUTONAV, JPL WOULD AVOID MOST DEVELOPMENT COSTS, PROVIDING ONLY NEW ALGORITHMS FROM ITS NAVIGATION SECTION TO PLUG INTO THE AUTONAV MARK 4 ARCHITECTURE. HUMAN SPACEFLIGHT COULD USE AUTONAV MARK 4 FOR NAVIGATION AND TRAJECTORY CALCULATION IN THE EVENT OF COMMUNICATIONS FAILURE, ALLOWING SAFE REENTRY THE ATMOSPHERE AND LANDING WITHOUT GROUND INTERACTION."

DURING THE JUST FINISHED PHASE I STTR PROJECT, BLUECOM SYSTEMS WAS ABLE TO DEVELOP A COMPREHENSIVE DESIGN FOR REALIZING SUCH A WACR ANDDEMONSTRATE THE PROOF-OF-CONCEPT OPERATION IN A HARDWARE-IN-THE-LOOP SIMULATION. THE DEVELOPED DESIGN CONSISTS OF THREE MODULES: A COGNITIVE ENGINE, A SOFTWARE-DEFINED RADIO (SDR)PLATFORM AND A RECONFIGURABLE RF FRONT-END. THE KEY MODULE THAT MAKES THE RADIO A WACR IS THE COGNITIVE ENGINE THAT ACTS AS THE BRAIN OF THE SYSTEM. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PHASE II PROJECT IS TO PROTOTYPE A SPACE TELECOMMUNICATIONS RADIO SYSTEM (STRS)-COMPLIANT PLUG-N-PLAY COGNITIVE ENGINE, CALLED THE RADIOBOT 1.0, THAT CAN TRANSFORM ANY SUITABLY DESIGNED SDR IN TO A WACR. DURING PHASE II, BLUECOM WILL BUILD ON THE SUCCESS OF PHASE I TO DEVELOP A SUITE OF ALGORITHMS THAT WILL MAKE UP THE COGNITIVE ENGINE: ALGORITHMS FOR SPECTRUM KNOWLEDGE ACQUISITIONAND PROTOCOLS FOR COGNITIVE COMMUNICATIONS. THE LATTER WILL SPECIFICALLY BE AIMED AT NETWORKS FORMED BY CLUSTERS OF SMALLER SATELLITES SUCH AS CUBESATS. NEXT, THESE ALGORITHMS WILL BE IMPLEMENTED ON AN FPGA SYSTEM-ON-CHIP (SOC). RADIOBOT 1.0 PROTOTYPE WILL BE COMPLETED BY DEVELOPING A PLUG-N-PLAY INTERFACE BETWEEN THE FPGA-IMPLEMENTED COGNITIVE ENGINE AND ANY STRS-COMPLIANT SDR. WACR TECHNOLOGY OPERATION WILL BE DEMONSTRATED BY INTEGRATING THIS RADIOBOT 1.0 COGNITIVE ENGINE WITH SUITABLE SDR PLATFORMS AND IN PARTICULAR THOSE THAT OPERATE IN KA BAND. BEYOND OBVIOUS BENEFITS TO NASA IN REALIZING AUTONOMOUS AND INTELLIGENT COMMUNICATION NETWORKS REQUIRED TO EXPLOIT THE FULL POTENTIAL OF NETWORKED CLUSTERS OF CUBESATS, RADIOBOT1.0 WILL ALSO FIND COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS IN FIRST-RESPONDER/EMERGENCY/PUBLIC SAFETY COMMUNICATIONS, AUTONOMOUS SYSTEMS AND DRONES AS WELL AS MANY OTHER MILITARYCOMMUNICATIONS."

      "description": "This procurement is a result of a NASA Research Announcement (NRA), NNH07ZEA001N-IRAC1 that was issued on June 8, 2007 to solicit proposals in support of NASA's Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate (ARMD).  One of the proposals, Dynamic Flight Envelope Assessment and Prediction\" (proposal number 07-IRAC-07-0034) submitted by The Boeing Company (DBA Boeing), was selected to support the Aviation Safety Program, and in particular the Integrated Resilient Aircraft Control (IRAC) Project.  The primary goal of the Dynamic Flight Envelope Assessment and Prediction program is to provide NASA with flight safety enhancement through a process to identify fault damage anomalies in air-vehicle structure, predict an allowable flight maneuver loads envelope for the damaged vehicle, and measure changes in structure dynamics mode shapes due to the damage. The system will also provide adaptive control to maintain the aircraft within the structure limits and suppress any adverse structure dynamic mode interaction with the flight control system. The program's primary focus is on Control-Centric Modeling, combining rigid body models with dynamic flexible structure and loads models to provide the basis for on-line adaptive control of the structure properties of the aircraft. Program products will be algorithms and processes that can provide control of structures properties for tactical and transport aircraft. This program addresses system anomalies caused by battle damage to military aircraft and structure failures to civil aircraft caused by incidents such as fatigue, corrosion, mid-air collisions, or improper procedures. The program builds on the NASA Intelligent Flight Control System technology, already demonstrated on a research F-15 for adaptive control of the aerodynamic capability of a damaged aircraft. The significance of this program is to add a capability by using adaptive control to prevent excessive structure loads or dynamic interaction, thereby increasing the safety and survivability of air and space vehicles. The program will assist NASA on meeting the objectives of the NASA Aviation Safety Program. This program addresses IRAC Topic 1.3, Dynamic Flight Envelope Assessment and Prediction.   This acquisition will result in a three year Cost-plus-Fixed-Fee contract to be conducted by The Boeing Company, Phantom Works division, St. Louis, MO for a total amount of $1,127,367.  \""

      "description": "The purpose of this contract is to implement the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite (TDRS) H, I, and J program. The main purpose of this program is to produce and deliver to NASA three Tracking and Data Relay Satellites designated as TDRS H, I and J. These satellites will be used to continue the present function of the existing TDRS Spacecraft. The TDRS H, I and J shall be fully compatible with, and be capable of functioning as a part of, the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS) as implemented and operated by the White Sands Complex (WSC) which includes the Second TDRS Ground Terminal (STGT) and the White Sands Ground Terminal Upgrade (WSGTU). The TDRS H, I, and J Program shall encompass all of the efforts required to design, develop, build, test, ship, and support the launch and on-orbit activation of three Tracking and Data Relay Satellites. These satellites shall be delivered to NASA at the Eastern Test Range. The contractor shall be responsible for providing necessary efforts required for the pre-launch and launch operations with the expendable launch vehicle provided by the Government. Upon successful injection into a geosynchronous orbit, the contractor shall perform a checkout and activation of the spacecraft and shall support the integration of the spacecraft into the operational Space Network. The contractor is required to deliver three satellites that are fully compatible and operational with the remainder of the TDRSS and all TDRSS users. Changes to the existing space-to-space link between the TDRS and the users, and changes to other existing operational interfaces between user spacecraft and existing user services are not permitted. The WSC, in its STGT and WSGTU implementation, will operate the TDRS H, I and J to provide the specified user services. The contractor's delivered satellites and other efforts must meet all specifications of TDRS-RP-SY-001. The operations of the TDRS H, I, and J system and spacecraft shall, quantitatively and qualitatively, perform as well as or better than the existing TDRS and the existing WSC flight operations. In the event that the contractor's satellite design or implementation is not fully compatible and operational with the baseline WSC and TDRSS as provided by NASA, the contractor is responsible for designing, implementing, documenting and validating changes to the WSC, to assure the required compatibility and operability. The Ka-Band Option service shall have all of the attributes of the existing Ku-Band service except for the full time simulation and verification capability known in the STGT implementation as the end-to-end test system. The baseline configuration of the WSC includes six Space Ground Link Terminals (SGLT's). Four SGLT's shall be changed to accommodate the TDRS H, I, and J design. The changes made by the contractor to the WSC must not adversely affect the operations of the WSC with the F-l through F-7 spacecraft. Additionally, the effort of implementing these changes by the contractor shall not cause any adverse impacts to on-going operations except for the temporary removal of a single SGLT at a time. The contractor shall also design, develop, implement, test and deliver the TDRS H, I, and J Spacecraft Emulator (TSE) and the Real-Time Telemetry Monitoring System (RTMS)."

THE PHASE II COMPONENT OF THIS GOAL IS TO FULLY TEST THE PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS OF A PROTOTYPE DEPLOYABLE ANTENNA REFLECTOR, WITH AN APERTURE GREATER THAN 0.5 M UNDER CONTROLLED CONDITIONS. THE MESH USED IN THE REFLECTOR IS GOLD PLATED MOLYBDENUM. THE WEAVE OF THE MESH WILL BE DEVELOPED EARLY IN PHASE II TO ACHIEVE THE TIGHT TOLERANCES REQUIRED FOR OPERATION UP TO 100 GHZ (W-BAND). CHARACTERIZATION MEASUREMENTS OF THE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE MESH HAVE BEEN COMPLETED AND WILL BE USED AS A BASELINE TO QUANTIFY IMPROVEMENTS MEASURED FROM THE NEWLY DEVELOPED MESH SAMPLES. ANALYSIS OF SURFACE ERROR CONTRIBUTIONS FROM FACETING, THERMAL STRESSES, MANUFACTURING TOLERANCES, AND OPERATIONAL FORCES WILL BE PERFORMED. MICRO-MACHINING AND SMALL-SCALE MANUFACTURING TECHNIQUES WILL BE REFINED TO ACHIEVE AN OVERALL REFLECTOR SURFACE ACCURACY OF LESS THAN 60 MICROMETERS (1/50 OF THE WAVELENGTH AT 100 GHZ). THE FULLY CONSTRUCTED MESH REFLECTOR ANTENNA WITH FEED WILL BE MEASURED TO OBTAIN THE FULL GAIN PATTERN OF THE ANTENNA TO CHARACTERIZE THE ANTENNA PERFORMANCE AND DETERMINE THE OVERALL EFFICIENCY OF THE MESH REFLECTOR. THE DEPLOYMENT MECHANISM WILL ALSO BE TESTED AND REFINED TO ENSURE REPEATABLE OPERATION OF THE ANTENNA. THE PROPOSED ANTENNA CAN BE STOWED WITHIN LESS THAN 1.5 U OF A CUBESAT. DOING SO CAN SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THE COST OF ANY SATELLITE SYSTEM REQUIRING A HIGH GAIN REFLECTOR ANTENNA, INCLUDING RADARS, SCATTEROMETERS, RADIOMETERS, AND DEEP SPACE COMMUNICATION LINKS.

TIME OF FLIGHT MEASUREMENTS INDICATED MIXED MODE OPERATION (DROPLETS/IONS), INDICATING THAT UPDATED THRUST CONTROL ALGORITHMS MAY BE NECESSARY, AS PRESENT IMPLEMENTATIONS FOCUS ON DROPLET OR ION DOMINATED EMISSION. THRUST MODULATIONS WERE DEMONSTRATED VIA CONTROL OF FLOW RATE AND BEAM VOLTAGE, DEMONSTRATING DEEP THROTTLING AND OPERATION OVER A WIDE RANGE OF CONDITIONS. SIZE, WEIGHT, AND POWER (SWAP) FOR TWO INTEGRATED BET-1MN THRUSTER SYSTEMS WERE PROVIDED TO THE ROCCOR LLC AND USED TO DEVELOP REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BOOM. A NOTIONAL 2M DEPLOYABLE BOOM DESIGN WAS DEVELOPED AND STATIC LOAD MODELING PERFORMED TO IDENTIFY DEFLECTION. UNDER THE PHASE II EFFORT, BUSEK SHALL UPDATE TEST SETUPS TO INCLUDE IN-SITU MASS FLOW MEASUREMENT DURING DIRECT THRUST MEASUREMENT IN ORDER TO FULLY ASSESS THRUSTER PERFORMANCE. ADDITIONAL THRUSTER CHARACTERIZATION SHALL FOCUS ON COMPLETING PARAMETERIZED THRUSTER PERFORMANCE WHILE ALSO MEASURING THRUST NOISE, STABILITY, AND CAPTURING ELECTROSPRAY PLUME SWEEPS. UPDATED THRUST CONTROL ALGORITHMS WILL BE IMPLEMENTED IN HARDWARE/FIRMWARE AND COMMANDED THRUST CONTROL DEMONSTRATED AS PART OF AN INTEGRATED TEST WITH THE BET-1MN THRUSTER. DEPLOYABLE BOOM REQUIREMENTS WILL BE UPDATED AND A PROTOTYPE BOOM FABRICATED AND TESTED. STATIC LOAD TESTING WILL BE PERFORMED TO VALIDATE PHASE I MODELING RESULTS."

THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF THE PHASE II EFFORT IS TO DEMONSTRATE A COMPLETE, MINI ION PROPULSION SYSTEM THAT PROVIDES #tilde#3000SEC ISP HERETOFORE UNAVAILABLE TO CUBESATS, WITH A SOLID-STORABLE IODINE PROPELLANT. THIS TYPE OF PROPULSION TECHNOLOGY WOULD BE AHUGE MISSION ENABLER AND IDEAL FOR VOLUME-LIMITED SATELLITES SUCH AS CUBESATS. THE 6U BUS, COMBINEDWITH ION PROPULSION, HAS ALREADY SHOWN BEING HIGHLY ATTRACTIVE TO SCIENCE PAYLOAD DEVELOPERS TARGETINGTHE UPCOMING SLS/EM-1 LUNAR MISSION.DURING PHASE I BUSEK SUCCESSFULLY DEMONSTRATED THE WORLD''S FIRST IODINE-FUELED GRIDDED ION THRUSTERBIT-3. KEY PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS OF BIT-3 INCLUDE A COMPACT DESIGN ENVELOPE (<2U VOLUME),NOMINAL 60W CONSUMPTION, HIGHLY-THROTTLEABLE THRUST OF #tilde#1.4MN, AND ISP UP TO 3200SEC (NEARLYIDENTICAL AS WITH XENON). BIT-3 HAS A UNIQUE ADVANTAGE OF BEING IODINE-COMPATIBLE DUE TO ITS PLASMAGENERATION MECHANISM AND CONSTRUCTION MATERIAL. THE ABILITY TO USE IODINE AS PROPELLANT IS A TRUE GAMECHANGERFOR CUBESAT PROPULSION, BECAUSE IODINE CAN BE STORED AS A DENSE SOLID (AT 4.9G/CC) AND ITS SUB-TORR STORAGE PRESSURE ENABLES VERY LIGHTWEIGHT, EVEN PLASTIC TANKS. WITH A MERE 300CC IODINE TANKONBOARD, THE BIT-3 THRUSTER IS CAPABLE OF PROVIDING>2.8KM/S DELTA-V TO A 6U/12KG CUBESAT.THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF THE LUNARCUBE PROGRAM IS TO UNDERTAKE A MISSION TO THE MOON FROM GEO OR ATRANSLUNAR TRAJECTORY (SUCH AS THE EM-1 DROP-OFF) THAT WOULD DEMONSTRATE THE PROPULSION SYSTEM, ANDCARRY OUT A LUNAR SCIENCE PROGRAM AS A CAPABILITY DEMONSTRATION OF THE PLATFORM. DURING THIS MISSION, ARELATED GOAL IS TO DEMONSTRATE THAT MUCH OF THE SPACECRAFT''S MINIATURE ELECTRONICS, PRIMARILY C&DH,COMMUNICATIONS, AND THE PROPULSION SYSTEM''S PPU CAN BE BASED ON LOW COST COMPONENTS AND SURVIVETHE HARSH DEEP-SPACE ENVIRONMENT."

GIVEN A WATER-TIGHT SURFACE TRIANGULATION OF ARBITRARY COMPLEXITY AND A SET OF GENERATING POINTS (EFFECTIVELY CELL CENTERS), STITCH CAN EFFICIENTLY COMPUTE THE 3D CLIPPED VORONOI DIAGRAM AND OUTPUT A MESH. THIS APPROACH WAS DEMONSTRATED TO BE FAST AND SCALABLE, AS WELL AS ROBUST TO COMPLEX GEOMETRY: AN 11.4B CELL MESH OF THE NASA HL-CRM WAS GENERATED IN 22 MINUTES ON 43200 CORES. BECAUSE THE GENERATION OF THE VORONOI MESH IS ALREADY ACCOMPLISHED, THE TECHNICAL OBJECTIVES OF THIS PROPOSAL ARE FOCUSED ON INVESTIGATING AND OPTIMIZING THE DETAILS OF HOW THE GENERATING POINTS ARE SPATIALLY DISTRIBUTED. THE QUALITY OF STITCH''S MESHES RELATIVE TO DECISIONS REGARDING THE POINT CLOUD SPECIFICATION HAVE YET TO BE FULLY CHARACTERIZED. OBVIOUSLY THE POINT CLOUD, ESSENTIALLY THE SPATIAL DISCRETIZATION OF THE DOMAIN, WILL HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON SOLUTION ACCURACY. WE WILL ASSESS SENSITIVITY WITH RESPECT TO SEVERAL ASPECTS OF THE SPATIAL ARRANGEMENT OF THE POINT CLOUD. WITHIN THE VORONOI-PARADIGM UNIFORM ISOTROPIC CELLS, WHICH CAN IMPART HIGHER-MOMENT CONSERVATION PROPERTIES APPROPRIATE FOR TURBULENCE, CAN BE ACHIEVED BY ARRANGING THE GENERATING SITES WITH A STRUCTURED LATTICE. THE DIFFERENT UNIT CELL TOPOLOGIES BASED ON CHOICE OF LATTICE WILL BE INVESTIGATED. ADDITIONALLY, UNDERSTANDING THESE LATTICES AT RESOLUTION TRANSITIONS IS OF INTEREST. ANOTHER FOCUS IS FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF ANISOTROPIC BODY-CONFORMAL MESH GENERATION. USING ONLY ISOTROPIC CELLS CAN INTRODUCE LARGE CELL COUNTS IN REGIONS WHICH COULD LEVERAGE ANISOTROPIC ARRANGEMENT AND RETAIN FIDELITY FOR BOTH WALL-RESOLVED AND WALL-MODELED SIMULATIONS. A FINAL FOCUS OF THIS WORK WILL BE TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL SOLVERS THAT CAN BENEFIT FROM AND UTILIZE THE VORONOI MESHING TECHNOLOGY. THIS WILL CHARACTERIZE POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS AND THE MARKET FOR STITCH AS A STAND-ALONE PRODUCT.\""

IN PHASE II, WE WILL DEVELOP FURTHER INSIGHT INTO PHYSICAL MECHANISMS IN THE DIODES VIA DEVELOPMENT ANDAPPLICATION OF ADVANCED PHYSICS MODELS. WE WILL PARAMETRICALLY ANALYZE DESIGN FEATURES TO IDENTIFY PROMISING HARDNESS SOLUTIONS, WHICH WILL THEN BE FABRICATED AND EXPERIMENTALLY CHARACTERIZED. WE WILL ALSO PERFORM HEAVY-ION TESTING OF 1200V SIC MOSFETS AND APPLY SIMULATIONS FOR INSIGHTS INTO GOVERNING MECHANISMS (TO BE FURTHER DEVELOPED IN FOLLOW ON WORK). DIRECT PARTICIPATION BY WOLFSPEED IN PHASE II AND BEYOND WILL ENSURE SPACE-QUALIFIED, SIC POWER DEVICES FOR NASA APPLICATIONS."

FOR LARGER COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFTS OPERATING IN THE MEGA-WATT RANGE, POWER TURBOELECTRIC AND HYBRID ELECTRIC AIRCRAFT PROPULSION WILL CONTINUE TO RELY ON GAS TURBINE ENGINES/GENERATORS TO PROVIDE PART OF THE THRUST, CHARGING BATTERIES AND DRIVING GENERATORS. AS A RESULT, REDUCTION OF EMISSIONS SUCH AS OXIDES OF NITROGEN (NOX) REMAINS A KEY CONCERN. THE INNOVATION PROPOSED IS A SOFTWARE TOOLKIT SUPPORTING HIGH-FIDELITY YET COMPUTATIONALLY-TRACTABLE PREDICTIONS OF NOX EMISSIONS AND OTHER POLLUTANTS IN GAS-TURBINE ENGINES/GENERATORS WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF UNSTEADY COMPUTATIONAL FLUID DYNAMICS (CFD) SIMULATIONS. A WELL-KNOWN DIFFICULTY LIMITING THE ACCURATE PREDICTION OF NOX LEVELS IN TURBULENT FLAMES IS RELATED TO THE FACT THAT NOX PRODUCTION CAN EVOLVE THROUGH SEVERAL DIFFERENT CHEMICAL PATHWAYS CHARACTERIZED BY DRASTICALLY DIFFERENT TIME SCALES. IN THIS REGARD, A FAST-RUNNING TURBULENT COMBUSTION APPROACH CALLED MULTI-TIMESCALE FLAMELET/PROGRESS VARIABLE (MTS-FPV) IS BEING DEVELOPED TO ADDRESS NOX EMISSIONS IN A COMPUTATIONALLY-TRACTABLE MANNER AND BY CAPTURING THE RELEVANT CHARACTERISTIC CHEMICAL TIME SCALES. THE MTS-FPV FORMULATION WILL BE MATURED AND EXTENDED TO MODEL TWO-PHASE DROPLET VAPORIZATION AND THEN SUBSEQUENTLY PACKAGED AS A SOFTWARE TOOLKIT. FURTHERMORE, THIS SOFTWARE TOOLKIT WILL BE INTERFACED WITH NASA S OPENNCC CFD CODE. AS A RESULT, AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE SBIR PROGRAM, NASA WILL HAVE AVAILABLE IN-HOUSE (I) THE ENHANCED EMISSION PREDICTION CAPABILITIES OF OPENNCC AS WELL AS (II) A METHODOLOGY FOR LEVERAGING THESE CAPABILITIES IN SYSTEM-LEVEL TRADE ANALYSES OF HYBRID ELECTRIC AIRCRAFT PROPULSION CONCEPTS."

WHILE THIS TYPE OF ETALON HAS BEEN IN USE FOR MANY YEARS, A DEVELOPMENT EFFORT IS UNDERTAKEN TO REDUCE THE TIME IT TAKES TO TUNE A LC ETALON OVER A FREE SPECTRAL RANGE FROM A FEW MILLISECONDS (CURRENT STATE OF THE ART) TO 100-500 MICROSECONDS (PROPOSED).

THE PRIMARY APPLICATION OF THIS TECHNOLOGY IS INTEGRATION INTO A SPACE BASED LIDAR (LIGHT DETECTION AND RANGING) SYSTEM, PARTICULARLY IN DIFFERENTIAL ABSORPTION LIDAR (DIAL) SYSTEMS. DIAL IS ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL ACTIVE REMOTE SENSING TECHNIQUES DUE TO ITS SPATIAL AND ALTITUDE RESOLUTION, MEASUREMENT PRECISION, AND INSENSITIVITY TO SURFACE EMISSIVITY.

IN PREPARATION FOR SUCH A MISSION, SPACECRAFT WILL HAVE TO PASS THROUGH CLOUDS OF ICE PARTICULATES, WHICH WILL POSE CHALLANGES IN ORGANIC SPECIES COLLECTION, AND POSSIBLE DAMAGE TO INSTRUMENTS. ACCORDINGLY, THERE IS A NEED FOR SIMULATING THE PRODUCTION OF HYPER VELOCITY ICE IN THE SIZE RANGE OF 50NM THROUGH 2 MICRONS. THE NASA AMES VERTICAL GUN RANGE WAS DESIGNED TO PROPELL SOLID PROJECTILES FOR STUDYING THE EFFECTS OF METEORITE IMPACTS ON CELESTIAL BODIES AND POTENTIAL MICRO-METEOROID DAMAGE TO SPACECRAFT.  AT THE FAR END OF THE BARREL, A GUNPOWDER EXPLOSION IS USED TO COMPRESS HYDROGEN GAS TO AS MUCH AS 1 MILLION TIMES ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE, FIRING A PROJECTILE PELLET AT SPEEDS BETWEEN 7,000 AND 15,000 MPH . THIS APPROACH IS NOT SUITABLE FOR ICE PARTICLES, SO WE HAVE DEVELOPED A NOVEL ICE GUN USING ELECTROSPRAYS THAT CAN ACHIEVE A HYPER VELOCITY NET RESULT WITHOUT DAMAGE TO THE SAMPLE GRAIN."

TWO-PHASE PUMPED LOOPS ARE AN IDEAL SOLUTION FOR THESE APPLICATIONS. A CRITICAL NEED FOR THESE PUMPED LOOPS IS A MICROGRAVITY-COMPATIBLE EVAPORATOR HAVING A LARGE COOLING AREA TO MAINTAIN THE TEMPERATURES OF MULTIPLE ELECTRONICS AND INSTRUMENTS. THE EVAPORATOR MUST BE ABLE TO ACCOMMODATE MULTIPLE HEAT LOADS WITH A WIDE RANGE OF HEAT FLUX DENSITIES AND ALLOW HEAT LOADS TO BE MOUNTED ON ANY AVAILABLE LOCATIONS OF ITS COOLING SURFACES TO FACILITATE VEHICLE-LEVEL SYSTEM INTEGRATION. TO THIS END, CREARE PROPOSES TO DEVELOP A LIGHTWEIGHT, COMPACT EVAPORATOR WITH INNOVATIVE INTERNAL DESIGN FEATURES TO ADAPTIVELY DISTRIBUTE LIQUID REFRIGERANT TO HEATED AREAS, PREVENTING DRYOUT IN AREAS WITH HIGH HEAT FLUX. THIS ADVANCED FLOW DISTRIBUTION FEATURE REDUCES LIQUID RECIRCULATION FLOW IN THE PUMPED LOOP AND THUS THE SYSTEM POWER INPUT. THE DESIGN FEATURES ALSO PROVIDE STRONG INTERNAL STRUCTURAL SUPPORT FOR THE EVAPORATOR, REDUCING THE SIZE AND MASS OF THE EVAPORATOR COVER PLATES. IN PHASE I, WE PROVED THE FEASIBILITY OF THE EVAPORATOR BY DEVELOPING A PRELIMINARY EVAPORATOR DESIGN, PREDICTING ITS OVERALL PERFORMANCE, AND DEMONSTRATING ITS KEY PERFORMANCE FEATURES AND FABRICATION PROCESSES BY TESTING. IN PHASE II, WE WILL OPTIMIZE THE EVAPORATOR DESIGN, FABRICATE A 0.5 M X 0.5 M EVAPORATOR, DEMONSTRATE ITS STEADY STATE AND TRANSIENT PERFORMANCE IN A REPRESENTATIVE PUMPED LOOP, AND DELIVER IT TO NASA JPL FOR FURTHER PERFORMANCE EVALUATION."

CROSSTRAC ENGINEERING, INC., IN COOPERATION WITH OUR PARTNERS PROFESSOR KERRI CAHOY OF THE MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY AND MR. PAUL GRAVEN OF CATENI, INC., PROPOSES TO DEVELOP A FREE SPACE OPTICAL COMMUNICATIONS AND RANGING SYSTEM WITH INHERENT PRECISION POINTING AS A 1U MODULE FOR 3U AND LARGER CUBESATS REQUIRING INTERSATELLITE CROSSLINKS. BASED ON TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPED BY PROFESSOR CAHOY AND HER TEAM AT MIT, THE MODULE WILL ENABLE SMALL SATELLITES TO ACHIEVE THE SUB-MILLIRADIAN POINTING CONTROL OF THE OPTICAL BEAM NECESSARY TO CLOSE LASER CROSSLINKS AT RANGES FROM 200 KM TO 1000 KM WITH INPUT POWER OF LESS THAN 20 W AND DATA RATES OF 100 MBPS AND GREATER, ALL WITHIN A 10 CM X 10 CM X 10 CM (1U) VOLUME OR SMALLER. THE PROPOSED WORK IS DIRECTLY ALIGNED WITH THE STTR SOLICITATION T11.02 AND THE OBJECTIVES OF TECHNOLOGY AREA 5.1 OPTICAL COMMUNICATIONS AND NAVIGATION IN THE NASA 2015 TECHNOLOGY ROADMAP. OPTICAL CROSSLINKS ARE A KEY TECHNOLOGY THAT WILL ENABLE NEW MULTI-SPACECRAFT CUBESAT AND MICROSATELLITE MISSIONS. THESE MISSIONS INCLUDE LARGE CONSTELLATIONS FOR GLOBAL DATA DISTRIBUTION AND RAPID RESPONSE EARTH IMAGING AND ASSET TRACKING AS WELL AS SWARM MISSIONS THAT, AMONG OTHER TASKS, CAN BE FORMED INTO SPARSE APERTURE SYSTEMS PROVIDING UNPRECEDENTED IMAGE RESOLUTION. THESE SWARM MISSIONS REQUIRE PRECISE RELATIVE POSITION KNOWLEDGE AS WELL. THE OPTICAL TERMINAL BEING DEVELOPED UNDER THIS EFFORT WILL PROVIDE THIS SUB-MM LEVEL RELATIVE POSITION KNOWLEDGE. FURTHERMORE, THE FREE SPACE OPTICAL CROSSLINKS CAN BE USED TO MAKE ATMOSPHERIC COMPOSITION AND THERMOPHYSICAL MEASUREMENTS (E.G., VIA LASER OCCULTATION)."

AS DESCRIBED IN NASA S REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL, OCI-DET-SOW-0067 AND OCI-DET-SPEC- 0015 DOCUMENTS, THE PRIMARY TECHNICAL CHALLENGE FOR THESE INGAAS PHOTODIODES IS TO ACHIEVE A CAPACITANCE LESS THAN 11 PF AT NEAR PHOTOVOLTAIC OPERATION WITH AN ACTIVE AREA DIAMETER OF 350ÔÅ≠M. SUCH A LOW CAPACITANCE DEVICE REQUIRES AN INGAAS PHOTODIODE STRUCTURE HAVING A CAPACITANCE PER UNIT AREA OF<114 PF / MM2 AT A REVERSE BIAS OF 100 MV. ALSO, THESE DEVICES MUST WITHSTAND A PROTON RADIATION UP TO A FLUENCE LEVEL OF 2E10 / CM2 FOR AN ENVISIONED 3-YEAR LONG MISSION. THESE PHOTODIODES MUST BE INTEGRATED WITH JFET AMPLIFIERS IN A KOVAR PACKAGE, BOTH SUPPLIED BY NASA GODDARD SPACE FLIGHT CENTER (GSFC), TO MANUFACTURE SPACE-QUALIFIED PHOTODIODE SUBASSEMBLIES. DISCOVERY SEMICONDUCTORS SUBMITTED A PROPOSAL, TITLED SHORT-WAVE INFRARED INGAAS PHOTODIODE FOR OPTICAL COLOR INSTRUMENT (OCI) OF PACE MISSION, ON NOVEMBER 30, 2018. THE PROPOSAL LEVERAGED OUR PRIOR WORK IN DEVELOPING RAD-HARD, ULTRA-LOW NOISE, LARGE AREA INGAAS QUADRANT PHOTORECEIVERS FOR THE LASER INTERFEROMETER SPACE ANTENNA (LISA) MISSION, TO MANUFACTURE THE PACE PHOTODIODE FLIGHT UNITS. NASA REVIEWED OUR PROPOSAL AND SUGGESTED SPLITTING THE ACTIVITIES INTO THE FOLLOWING THREE OPTIONS FOR BUDGETARY REASONS: OPTION 1: PROCESS 350ÔÅ≠M DIAMETER PHOTODIODE CHIPS, AND DELIVER 10 CHIPS IN DIE FORM IN A GEL-PAK. OPTION 2: DESIGN AND MANUFACTURE (1) PHOTODIODE SUBMOUNT, (2) MOTHERBOARD SUBSTRATE, AND (3) CONTAINER NEEDED TO DEVELOP THE PHOTODIODE SUBASSEMBLY FLIGHT UNITS. WE WILL DELIVER 10 PHOTODIODE CHIPS MOUNTED ON PHOTODIODE SUBMOUNT AND MOTHERBOARD SUBSTRATE. OPTION 3: MANUFACTURE AND DELIVER 18 PHOTODIODE SUBASSEMBLY FLIGHT UNITS AND 18 FLIGHT SPARES WITH SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION. DISCOVERY ANTICIPATES THE ENTIRE EFFORT TO BE FUNDED AND WILL PERFORM THE VARIOUS TECHNICAL TASKS AS DESCRIBED IN OUR ORIGINAL PROPOSAL SUBMITTED ON NOVEMBER 30, 2018. THIS ADDENDUM DEFINES THE TASKS CATEGORIZED ACCORDING TO THE THREE OPTIONS AND THE CORRESPONDING BUDGET."

DEVELOPMENT OF HGCDTE LINEAR MODE PHOTON COUNTING AVALANCHE PHOTODIODE AARRAY ASSEMBLY FOR INFRARED LIDARS NASA GSFC IS DEVELOPING A MULTI-BEAM SWATH MAPPING LASER ALTIMETER FOR THE LIDAR SURFACE TOPOGRAPHY (LIST) MISSION RECOMMENDED IN THE NRC EARTH SCIENCE DECADAL SURVEY. ONE OF THE KEY COMPONENT IN THE LIST MISSION IS THE NEAR INFRARED PHOTODETECTOR ARRAY THAT CAN DETECT SINGLE TO MULTIPLE PHOTON LASER PULSES. WE HAVE IDENTIFIED A NEW TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPED AT DRS TECHNOLOGIES, RECONNAISSANCE, SURVEILLANCE AND TARGET ACQUISITION (RSTA), THAT PROMISE TO MEET THE LIST LIDAR REQUIREMENTS. OUR JOINT PROPOSAL, TITLED `HGCDTE INFRARED AVALANCHE PHOTODIODE SINGLE PHOTON DETECTOR ARRAYS FOR THE LIST AND OTHER DECADAL MISSIONS, TO NASA NRA NNH10ZDA001N, ROSES-2010, PROGRAM ELEMENT A.36, ADVANCED COMPONENT TECHNOLOGY PROGRAM (ACT), HAS BEEN SELECTED FOR FUNDING STARTING JANUARY 2012. ONE MAJOR ELEMENT OF THE PROPOSED ACTIVITIES IS TO PARTNER WITH DRS TO DEVELOP AN LINEAR MODE SINGLE PHOTON HGCDTE AVALANCHE PHOTODIODE INFRARED DETECTOR ASSEMBLY. THE SYSTEM CONSISTS OF INTEGRATED HIGH BANDWIDTH AND LOW NOISE PREAMPLIFIER ARRAY WITH THE PHOTODIODE ARRAY ON THE SAME SUBSTRATE AND A COOLING SYSTEM WITH OPTICAL WINDOWS FOR A LABORATORY DEMONSTRATION. THE DETECTOR SYSTEM WHICH USES DRS COMPANY PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGY AND PROCESSES IS EXPECTED TO SIGNIFICANTLY ADVANCE THE TECHNOLOGY READINESS LEVEL FOR LIST MISSION, IMPROVE THE MEASUREMENT PERFORMANCE, AND ENABLE A LONG OPERATION LIFETIME IN SPACE. THE TECHNOLOGY CAN ALSO BENEFIT OTHER NASA LIDAR AND PASSIVE REMOTE SENSING MISSIONS THAT NEED NEAR INFRARED PHOTON FOCAL PLAN ARRAY DETECTORS. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS ACQUISITION IS FOR DRS RSTA TO DEVELOP A CUSTOM LINEAR MODE PHOTON COUNTING HGCDTE ELECTRON-AVALANCHE PHOTODIODE (E-APD) SYSTEM WITH AN INTEGRATED HIGH SPEED AND LOW NOISE PREAMPLIFIER FOR OPERATION AT 1 TO 4 UM AND COUPLING OPTICS FOR A LABORATORY DEMONSTRATION WITH OUR EXISTING SWATH MAPPING INSTRUMENT. THE PREAMPLIFIER(S) IS TO HAVE A BANDWIDTH GREATER THAN THE INTRINSIC BANDWIDTH OF THE APDS AND SUFFICIENT TO RESOLVE SINGLE PHOTON EVENT. THE TOTAL NOISE INTEGRATED OVER THE BANDWIDTH MUST BE LOWER THAN THE APD PHOTOCURRENT PULSE FROM A SINGLE PHOTON EVENT. THE HGCDTE E-APD SYSTEM IS TO INCLUDE A PORTABLE AND LONG HOLD LIQUID NITROGEN DEWAR AND THE SUPPORTING ELECTRONICS.  FABRICATION OF THE CMOS READ OUT INTEGRATED CIRCUIT (ROIC) FOR THE HGCDTE APD SYSTEM.

THE CRITICAL BARIUM REDUCTION PROCESS OCCURS IN THE RESERVOIR, NOT IN THE MATRIX, AND THIS ISOLATES THAT PROCESS FROM IODINE POISONING. ALSO, THE BARIUM SUPPLY IS 100 TIMES GREATER THAN IS AVAILABLE IN CONVENTIONAL CATHODES. THIS ALLOWS MUCH HIGHER RATES OF BARIUM TO FLOW TO THE CATHODE S SURFACE   ENOUGH TO OVERCOME IODINE POISONING. ALSO, METALS RESISTANT TO IODINE ATTACK CAN BE USED IN THE CATHODE MATRIX. WE PROPOSE CONSTRUCTING LARGE NUMBERS OF RESERVOIR CATHODES WITH VARIOUS COMPOSITIONS AND ACTIVITIES. WE PROPOSE A SYSTEMATIC STUDY OF THESE CATHODES IN IODINE TO DISCOVER THE FACTORS WHICH PROVIDE THE SUCCESSFUL PERFORMANCE. WE ALSO PROPOSE A MINIATURE RESERVOIR CATHODE FOR USE IN CUBESATS, WHERE IODINE''S COMPACTNESS IS MOST APPEALING. NASA IS PURSUING IODINE EP BECAUSE OF ITS MANY ADVANTAGES OVER XENON. THESE INCLUDE LOW COST AND HIGH STORAGE DENSITY."

THE MAJORITY OF CODING AND DEBUGGING TIME IS NOT SPENT DEFINING THE PROBLEM PHYSICS BUT INSTEAD IN BALANCING COMPUTATIONS BETWEEN MULTIPLE HETEROGENEOUS DEVICES, HANDLING COMMUNICATION OF DATA, MANAGING DISTRIBUTED MEMORY SYSTEMS, AND PROVIDING FAULT-TOLERANCE. OFTEN, THE RESULTING PROGRAMS ARE BARELY READABLE AS THE DETAILS OF THE WORK BEING PERFORMED ARE OBSCURED BY HARDWARE-SPECIFIC SETUP AND COMMUNICATION CODE THAT DOMINATES A PROGRAM''S CODEBASE. EVEN WORSE, THE CODE USED TO BALANCE COMPUTATION, MANAGE DATA COMMUNICATION, AND PROVIDE FAULT-TOLERANCE IS RE-IMPLEMENTED IN EACH PIECE OF AN APPLICATION EVEN THOUGH IT PERFORMS THE SAME TASKS ACROSS THOSE SECTIONS OF THE SOFTWARE. THIS MAKES SOFTWARE MORE DIFFICULT TO MAINTAIN AND UPGRADE, AND HINDERS PORTING TO NEW HARDWARE PLATFORMS AS THEY BECOME AVAILABLE. THE TIME SPENT IMPROVING, MODIFYING, OR DEBUGGING THESE DEVICE SPECIFIC CODE PATHS AND COMMON CODE SECTIONS COULD BE BETTER SPENT IMPROVING KERNEL PERFORMANCE OR ADDING NEW FEATURES. TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM OF SEPARATING PHYSICAL SCIENCE FROM COMPUTING SCIENCE, WE ARE DEVELOPING A SOLUTION THAT DECOUPLES THE PROBLEM DEFINITION FROM THE PLATFORM-SPECIFIC IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS. THIS IS ACCOMPLISHED BY DIVIDING THE COMPUTATION INTO DISTINCT TASKS, EACH OF WHICH TAKES SOME DEFINED INPUT DATA AND PRODUCES SOME OUTPUT DATA. THESE TASKS CAN THEN BE CONNECTED INTO A TASK GRAPH BY DEFINING THEIR DEPENDENCIES ON EACH OTHER. THIS TASK GRAPH DESCRIBING A PARTICULAR CODE CAN THEN BE USED TO AUTOMATICALLY MANAGE DATA AND SCHEDULE WORK ACROSS HETEROGENEOUS DEVICES WITHOUT REQUIRING FURTHER USER INTERVENTION. THEREFORE, TO MAKE USE OF NEW HARDWARE, THE USER NEED ONLY PORT ANY TASKS THAT MIGHT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE NEW HARDWARE, AND ALL SCHEDULING, DATA MANAGEMENT, AND SYNCHRONIZATION REQUIRED ARE HANDLED AUTOMATICALLY."

THE PURPOSE OF THE PHASE II PROGRAM IS TO COMPLETE THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN SMART ELECTROANALYTICAL MULTI-SENSOR (SEMS) DEVICE FOR ANALYSIS AND PROCESS CONTROL OF BIOCIDAL SILVER IN POTABLE WATER, WITH THE OPTION INTEGRATING AN AG+ ION GENERATOR. THE DEVICE WILL AUTOMATICALLY PROVIDE CONTINUOUS AND ON-DEMAND MAINTENANCE OF AG+ ION BIOCIDE LEVELS IN SPACECRAFT WATER STREAMS AND STORAGE TANKS, AS WELL AS PROVIDING OUTPUT DATA FOR SILVER CONCENTRATIONS AND A PROFILE OF TOTAL SILVER ADDED TO THE SYSTEM OVER TIME. CONSIDERABLE TEST WORK IS PLANNED UNDER AES PROGRAMS AND, GIVEN SILVER ION''S ''ELUSIVENESS'' IN WATER SYSTEMS, THE DATA WILL BE FAR MORE RELIABLE IF THE METHODOLOGY FOR ADDING THE BIOCIDE AND MEASURING ITS CONCENTRATION IS PERFORMED BY A RELIABLE AND FLIGHTQUALIFIABLE DESIGN FROM THE BEGINNING. PHASE I CULMINATED IN A VALIDATED ANALYTICAL METHODOLOGY AND 4 FLIGHT PREPRODUCTION PROTOTYPE FOR MEASUREMENT AND CONTROL OF SILVER ION AT SUB-PPB LEVELS IN FINISHED WATERS. THE PHASE II TECHNICAL OBJECTIVES AND WORK PLAN ARE DEDICATED TO FABRICATION, TEST&DELIVERY OF 3 FLIGHT-QUALIFIABLE INSTRUMENTS THAT CONFORM TO SPACECRAFT APPLICATIONS AND SPECIFICATIONS AS DEFINED BY NASA. THE SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES WILL BE TO 1) DEVELOP A COMPLETE ANALYTICAL CHARACTERIZATION OF THE DETECTION METHOD, INCLUSIVE OF AUTOMATED AUTOCALIBRATION AND QA/QC FUNCTIONS, 2) DEVELOP AUTOMATED MACHINE-LEARNING CAPABILITY TO SUPPORT AGILE&RELIABLE OPERATION IN LONG-DURATION MISSIONS, 3) DEMONSTRATE THE FEEDBACK CONTROL FUNCTION TO MAINTAIN CONSISTENT AG+ ION CONCENTRATION IN ACTIVE WATER SYSTEMS, AND 4) DEMONSTRATE ALL OPERATING PARAMETERS REQUIRED TO ANALYZE AG+ IN THE RANGES OF 50-5000 UG/L IN POTABLE WATER."

TELESCOPES WITH APERTURES OF 4-METERS OR LARGER AND USING AN INTERNAL CORONAGRAPH REQUIRE A TELESCOPE WAVEFRONT STABILITY THAT IS ON THE ORDER OF 10 PICO-METERS RMS PER 10 MINUTES. INTEREST IS ALSO FOR IR/FIR MISSIONS REQUIRING 8-METER OR LARGER DIAMETER MIRRORS WITH CRYOGENIC DEFORMATIONS<100 NM RMS. FANTOM MATERIALS IS SPECIFICALLY RESPONDING TO THE NEED FOR ULTRA-STABLE MIRROR SUPPORT STRUCTURE TRACEABLE TO THE NEEDS OF COSMIC ORIGINS FOR UVOIR, EXO AND FIR TELESCOPES, INCLUDING MIRROR SUPPORT STRUCTURES, WHIFFLE PLATES, DELTA FRAMES AND STRONGBACKS. HONEYSIC MATERIAL HAS MULTIPLE FEATURES THAT MAKE IT VERY ATTRACTIVE AS A POTENTIAL FUTURE DEPLOYMENT HINGE AND LATCHING MATERIAL: 1) IT''S AN ADDITIVELY MANUFACTURED CERAMIC MATRIX COMPOSITE (CMC) WITH NO COEFFICIENT OF MOISTURE EXPANSION (CME). INDIVIDUALLY MOLDED PARTS BECOME A MONOLITHIC CONSTRUCT, THUS IT IS POSSIBLE TO MANUFACTURE AN ENTIRE TELESCOPE USING HONEYSIC, 2) IT''S EXTREMELY LIGHT WEIGHT (HONEYSIC PANELS HAVE ABOUT 1/5 THE DENSITY OF BERYLLIUM, 3) IT''S EXTREMELY DIMENSIONALLY STABLE DUE TO A ZERO-CTE ACROSS A TEMPERATURE RANGE OF -196C TO RT. THE THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY CAN BE SUPERCHARGED BY ADDITION OF CARBON NANOTUBES. THE OVERARCHING PROGRAM OBJECTIVE IS TO DEMONSTRATE HONEYSIC AS AN ULTRA-STABLE STRUCTURAL TELESCOPE MATERIAL. IN PHASE I, FANTOM MEASURED CTE AND MECHANICAL PROPERTIES FOR HONEYSIC HCMC AND H2CMN TO BRING THE BASIC MATERIAL PROPERTIES MEASUREMENTS CLOSER TO COMPLETION. IN PHASE II FANTOM INTENDS TO IS TO CONTINUE COLLABORATION WITH NASA MSFC, GSFC, JPL AND NORTHROP GRUMMAN AEROSPACE SYSTEMS IN THE DESIGN OF A PROTOTYPE WHIFFLE PLATE, DELTA FRAME, TUBE STRUCTURE OR OTHER OPTICAL STRUCTURE THAT COULD BE USED TO SUPPORT MIRROR-CLASS, SPACE-BASED TELESCOPE APPLICATIONS, LIKE THE JWST COMPOSITE BACKPLANE."

      "description": "A BASIC REQUIREMENT FOR ALL DIFFERENTIAL ABSORPTION LIDAR (DIAL) SYSTEMS IS WAVELENGTH SWITCHING OF THE PROBE LASER ON AND OFF OF AN ABSORPTION LINE OF THE SPECIES OF INTEREST. FOR MOST TRACE GAS SPECIES SWITCHING ACCURACY ON THE ORDER OF 10 MHZ IS ALSO REQUIRED. FURTHER COMPLICATIONS FOR MANY DIAL SYSTEMS ARE THAT THE PLATFORM MOVES (AIRBORNE OR SPACE CRAFT) AND THAT THE LASERS ARE OFTEN HIGH PEAK POWER, PULSED LASERS. THE COMBINATION OF A MOVING PLATFORM, PULSED LASER, AND THE REQUIREMENT THAT THE ONLINE AND OFFLINE MEASUREMENTS BE MADE IN ESSENTIALLY THE SAME VOLUME IMPLIES THAT THE ONLINE/OFFLINE SWITCHING TIME BE LESS THAN #tilde# 1 MS, AND MANY CASES EVEN SHORTER. TO DATE, MOST LASERS USED IN DIAL SYSTEMS RELY ON PIEZOELECTRIC (PZT) MECHANISMS FOR THE CAVITY LENGTH CHANGES NEEDED FOR THE FREQUENCY SWITCHING. TYPICALLY THIS LIMITS WAVELENGTH SWITCHING SPEEDS TO A FEW HUNDRED HZ. THIS RELATIVELY SLOW FREQUENCY SWITCHING PREVENTS RESEARCHERS FROM FULLY EXPLOITING DIAL SYSTEMS UTILIZING THE HIGH EFFICIENCY, MULTI-KHZ LASERS OR THE LOWER REPETITION RATE, DUAL PULSE LASERS SYSTEMS THAT ARE NOW AVAILABLE. IN PHASE I, FIBERTEK DEMONSTRATED A BRASSBOARD VERSION OF A HIGH SPEED, NON-MECHANICAL FREQUENCY LOCKING MODULE THAT ALLOWED SHOT TO SHOT FREQUENCY SWITCHING OF A 1645.5 NM ER:YAG LASER AT>1 KHZ WITH A SPECTRAL PURITY OF 1,000:1. OUR APPROACH TO THE PROPOSED LOCKING MODULE WAS AN INNOVATIVE SYNTHESIS OF ALL ELECTRO-OPTIC (EO) BASED SWITCHING AND LOCKING, A COMPACT AND EFFICIENT EO DRIVER DESIGN THAT REDUCES VOLTAGE REQUIREMENTS BY 4X OVER CONVENTIONAL DESIGNS, A NOVEL EO VOLTAGE PROFILE THAT ELIMINATES ELECTROCHROMIC DARKENING, AND A LARGER OFF-SET LOCKING CAPABILITY THAT ELIMINATES THE REQUIREMENT FOR AN ADDITIONAL PHASE SHIFTER IN THE CAVITY. IN PHASE II WE WILL ADVANCE THE TRL OF THE KEY TECHNOLOGY COMPONENTS AND INCORPORATE A HARDENED VERSION OF THE LOCKING MODULE INTO A 1645.5 NM ER:YAG LASER THAT IS BEING DEVELOPED FOR A METHANE LIDAR BEING BUILT AT NASA LANGLEY."

ACCURATE MEASUREMENTS OF BOTH ATMOSPHERIC CONSTITUENTS ARE CRITICAL TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF GLOBAL ENERGY TRANSPORT AND CLIMATE CHANGE. UNDER OUR PHASE I PROGRAM, FIBERTEK SUCCESSFULLY DEMONSTRATED THE CAPABILITY OF A NEW LASER SOURCE, A DIODE-PUMPED FREQUENCY-DOUBLED ER:YAG LASER TO GENERATE MILLIJOULE OUTPUT NEAR 823 NM THAT WAS TUNABLE THROUGH WATER-VAPOR ABSORPTION LINES FOR DIAL MEASUREMENTS. THE NEW LASER SYSTEM OFFERS SIMPLICITY AND EFFICIENCY THAT WILL REDUCE RISK FOR FUTURE AIRBORNE AND SPACE-BASED MISSIONS. SIGNIFICANTLY, THE NEW LASER APPROACH OFFERS AN UPGRADE PATH WITH REDUCTION IN SIZE, WEIGHT, AND POWER (SWAP) CONSUMPTION OVER CURRENT STATE-OF-THE-ART DIAL BASED ON LESS-EFFICIENT NON-LINEAR PARAMETRIC CONVERSION OF DIODE-PUMPED ND:YAG LASERS.

THE THRUSTER CONCEPT CONSISTS OF AN INTEGRATED MICROTUBE/ELECTROSPRAY THRUSTER THAT SHARES ALL PROPULSION SYSTEM HARDWARE BETWEEN ELECTRIC AND CHEMICAL THRUSTER MODES, I.E. ONE PROPELLANT, ONE PROPELLANT TANK, ONE FEED SYSTEM, AND ONE THRUSTER. THUS, THE THRUSTER IS NOT SIGNIFICANTLY MORE MASSIVE THAN A STANDALONE STATE-OF-THE-ART CHEMICAL OR ELECTRIC THRUSTER, BUT CAPABLE OF EITHER THRUST MODE AND SELECTABLE AS MISSION NEEDS ARISE. THIS HAS SEVERAL BENEFITS, INCLUDING THE OPTIMIZATION OF TRAJECTORIES USING BOTH CHEMICAL AND ELECTRIC THRUST MANUEVERS AS WELL AS A SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED MISSION DESIGN SPACE FOR A SINGLE PROPULSION UNIT. THE PROPULSION SYSTEM IS CAPABLE OF BOTH HIGH IMPULSE PER UNIT VOLUME AND HIGH THRUST PER UNIT VOLUME AS THE TOTAL IMPULSE PER UNIT VOLUME IS 1500 N-S/U IN THE CHEMICAL THRUST MODE AND 2750 N-S/U IN THE ELECTRIC THRUST MODE, WHERE EITHER TYPE OF MANUEVER COULD BE SELECTED ON-THE-FLY. OPERATION AND HIGH PERFORMANCE IN BOTH MODES HAS PREVIOUSLY BEEN DEMONSTRATED AT THE SINGLE EMITTER LEVEL. THE SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES FOR THIS STUDY ARE TO DESIGN AND BUILD A CUBESAT SIZED MULTI-EMITTER THRUSTER AND TEST IN BOTH CHEMICAL AND ELECTROSPRAY MODES OF OPERATION. TWO THRUSTERS WILL BE BUILT AND SEPARATE CHEMICAL AND ELECTRIC THRUSTERS TESTED IN PARALLEL. THEN, BACK-TO-BACK OPERATION OF A SINGLE THRUSTER WILL BE DEMONSTRATED AND INDIRECT AND DIRECT PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENTS WILL BE ACQUIRED. ADDITIONALLY, THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE MULTI-MODE MONOPROPELLANT WILL BE FURTHERED THROUGH MATERIAL COMPATIBILITY TESTS AND HAZARD CLASSIFICATION. FINALLY, SYSTEM LEVEL ITEMS INCLUDING PPU AND AND FEED SYSTEM COMPONENTS WILL BE RESEARCHED AND SELECTED AND/OR DESIGNED.\""

IN ADDITION, TBC MATERIALS ARE DESIRED FOR RE-ENTRY AND HYPERSONIC VEHICLES THAT WILL EXPERIENCE BOTH SPACE AND ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS. ALL OF THESE SYSTEMS RELY ON THE LOW THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY AND EMISSIVE PROPERTIES OF THE CERAMIC TOPCOAT TO MINIMIZE HEAT TRANSFER. HOWEVER BECAUSE OF THE THERMAL EXPANSION MISMATCH BETWEEN THE CERAMIC TOPCOAT AND UNDERLYING METALLIC STRUCTURE, SPECIAL CARE MUST BE TAKEN DURING JOINING. THE PHASE I RESULTS SHOWED ADVANCED PLASMA SPRAY ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING TECHNIQUES CAN BE USED TO PRODUCE CERAMIC BASED TPS/TBC MATERIALS ON METALLIC SUBSTRATES AND THE ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY MODIFY CRITICAL PROPERTIES SUCH AS REFLECTANCE/EMISSIVITY AND THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY THROUGH RARE EARTH OXIDE ADDITIONS WERE DEMONSTRATED. DURING PHASE II, THE MOST PROMISING TPS MATERIALS WILL BE OPTIMIZED AND EXTENSIVE GROUND BASED TESTING WILL BE PERFORMED.

      "description": "THIS STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW) ADDRESSES THE REDESIGN OF THE GINER 3,600 PSI HIGH PRESSURE CELL STACK TO RESOLVE VOLTAGE STABILITY ISSUES. PREVIOUSLY, UNDER CONTRACT NNM15AA09C, GINER DESIGNED, ASSEMBLED AND TESTED A HIGH PRESSURE CELL STACK. THE EFFORT INVOLVED MODIFYING AN EARLIER DESIGN TO INCORPORATE DESIGN IMPROVEMENTS TO RESOLVE LEAKAGE ISSUES. GINER SUCCESSFULLY DEMONSTRATED #tilde#5,000 HOURS OF OPERATION, WITH NO LEAKAGE ISSUES. HOWEVER, THIS DESIGN EXHIBITED A HIGHER VOLTAGE THAN EXPECTED. EARLIER EFFORTS DEMONSTRATED A STABLE, FLAT VOLTAGE OF #tilde#1.8 V, WHILE THIS CELL STACK EXHIBITED RISING VOLTAGE UP TO #tilde#2.0 V. A FAULT TREE WAS DEVELOPED TO IDENTIFY THE POSSIBLE CAUSES. THE LIKELY CAUSE WAS IDENTIFIED TO BE LACK OF COMPLIANCE IN THE CELLS, WHICH LIKELY RESULTED IN OVER COMPRESSING AND DEHYDRATING OF THE MEMBRANES. IN ADDITION, THE CATHODE SCREENS EXPERIENCED A HEIGHT REDUCTION, RESULTING IN INCREASED RESISTANCE. THIS SBIR PHASE III EFFORT SHALL REQUIRE GINER TO REDESIGN SPECIFIC COMPONENTS OF THE STACK HARDWARE TO ENHANCE COMPLIANCE TO RESOLVE THE HIGH RESISTANCE AND VOLTAGE ISSUES. GINER WILL INCORPORATE A PRESSURE PAD INTO THE CATHODE COMPARTMENT OF THE CELLS TO MINIMIZE OVER COMPRESSION OF THE SCREEN AND MEMBRANE. A FOUR CELL STACK WILL BE ASSEMBLED AND PRE-TEST HEALTH CHECKS WILL BE PERFORMED. ENDURANCE TESTING WILL BE CONDUCTED TO VERIFY PERFORMANCE AND LIFE. THE STACK SHALL BE OPERATED CONTINUOUSLY AT 3600 PSI. AT THE COMPLETION OF ENDURANCE TESTING, POST-TEST HEALTH CHECKS SHALL BE PERFORMED. GINER SHALL ALSO BE REQUIRED TO ANALYZE THE DATA AND WRITE A FINAL REPORT. GINER SHALL BE REQUIRED TO DELIVER THE CELL STACK AND FINAL REPORT TO MSFC."

FOR THE INTEGRATION OF EVVA WITH NASA S NEXT GENERATION SPACE SUITS HELMET BUBBLE, DYNAMICALLY SWITCHING TECHNOLOGIES ARE NEEDED TO PROVIDE TINT-ABILITY, RADIATION PROTECTION, AND OPTIMIZED TRANSMITTANCE. GINER PROPOSES TO DEVELOP AN ELECTROCHROMIC SPACE SUIT HELMET BUBBLE THAT WOULD PROVIDE HIGH OPTICAL CONTRAST BETWEEN ITS CLEAR (TRANSPARENT) AND DARK (OPAQUE) STATES, TUNABLE SWITCHING, AND A CONTROL MODULE THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR BOTH USER AND AMBIENT LIGHT CONTROL.

OUR METER-CLASS 3D/AM SILICON CARBIDE SEGMENTS WILL MEET OR EXCEED ALL NASA REQUIREMENTS FOR THE PRIMARY MIRROR OF A FIR SURVEYOR SUCH AS THE ORIGINS SPACE TELESCOPE (OST), AND MAY ALSO PROVIDE A SOLUTION FOR THE LUVOIR SURVEYOR. DURING PHASE II WE ACHIEVED AN AREAL DENSITY OF 10 KG/SQUARE METER ON OUR FIRST ATTEMPT AT A PRODUCTION RATE OF 1.44 SQUARE METER PER DAY FOR A SINGLE SMALL PRINTER. A COST OF $60K TO 3D PRINT/AM LARGE SEGMENTS LOOKS READILY ACHIEVABLE, AS DOES AN OPTICAL SURFACE THAT HAS NANOMETER-SCALE TOLERANCES. OUR ENCAPSULATED LATTICE CONSTRUCTION PROVIDES A UNIFORM CTE THROUGHOUT THE PART FOR DIMENSIONAL STABILITY, INCREDIBLE SPECIFIC STIFFNESS, AND THE ADDED BENEFIT OF CRYO-DAMPING. OUR PROCESS WILL ALSO ALLOW FOR DIRECT EMBEDDING OF ELECTRONICS FOR ACTIVE STRUCTURES AND SEGMENTS, AND THE POTENTIAL FOR ACTIVELY COOLING WITH HELIUM FOR UNPRECEDENTED LOW EMISSIVITY AND THERMAL CONTROL. FINALLY, THE PARTICULATE PASTE EXTRUSION PROCESS MAY BE VERY SUITABLE FOR PRINTING MIRRORS IN THE ZERO GRAVITY OF SPACE. DURING PHASE II, WE PROPOSE TO OPTIMIZE, MATURE AND SCALE 3D PRINTED SILICON CARBIDE MIRRORS AND TELESCOPE STRUCTURES TRACEABLE TO OST AND LUVOIR SURVEYORS THROUGH THE DEMONSTRATION OF PATHFINDER SURROGATE COMPONENTS FOR A METER-CLASS PRIMARY MIRROR FOR THE NASA GONDOLA FOR HIGH ALTITUDE PLANETARY SCIENCE (GHAPS) PROJECT."

TELESCOPE DIMENSIONAL STABILITY, LOW SCATTER, EXTREME LIGHTWEIGHTING, AND PRECISION STRUCTURES ARE A COMMON THEME ACROSS THE NASA 2017 PHYSICS OF THE COSMOS AND COSMIC ORIGINS PROGRAM ANNUAL TECHNOLOGY REPORT. MULTIPLE PRIORITY TIER 1-4 TECHNOLOGY GAPS CAN BE FOUND, AND THE HIGHER PRIORITIES REQUIRE A SOLUTION IN TIME FOR THE NEXT DECADAL SURVEY. A COMMON SOLUTION OF INTEREST THAT HAS BEEN CITED IS SILICON CARBIDE AND 3D PRINTING OR ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING. ROBOSIC TECHNOLOGIES PROVIDE BOTH. GT PROPOSES TO DESIGN, 3D PRINT AND ADDITIVELY MANUFACTURE A PROTOTYPE GREGORIAN LCT USING THE PATENT PENDING ROBOSIC-S TECHNOLOGY DEMONSTRATED IN PHASE I, INCLUDING BOLTS, TRUSS STRUCTURES, MIRROR MOUNTS. OFF-AXIS MIRRORS WILL BE PRINTED. ROBOSIC-S PROVIDES THE DEGREE OF PASSIVE ATHERMALITY REQUIRED FOR THE LCT OPTICAL PATHLENGTH AND WAVEFRONT ERROR STABILITY, CONCOMITANT WITH LOW AREAL DENSITY MIRRORS (7.75-10 KG/M2) AND STRUCTURES (4-5 KG/M2), AND A THEORTICAL FIRST UNIT COST FOR AN LCT WITH A FAST STEERING MIRROR IS $1.5M, A FACTOR OF 3-4 LESS THAN CURRENT LCTS. A PHASE IIE PROJECT IS PLANNED WHICH WILL INTEGRATE 3D PRINTED ROBOSIC MIRRORS INTO THE TELESCOPE AND PERFORM ENVIRONMNETAL AND OTHER TESTS TO RAISE THE TRL TO 6 FOR COMMERCIAL SALES."

DURING PHASE II WE WILL WORK WITH THE NASA AND STSCI COLLABORATORS TO DETERMINE HOW TO IMPROVE THESE COMPONENTS AND DELIVER SECOND GENERATION COMPONENTS TO EXTEND THE PERFORMANCE OF THE STSCI TEST BED IN SUPPORT OF IMPLEMENTATION ON FUTURE NASA MISSIONS SUCH AS HABEX OR UVOIRS. IN ADDITION WE WILL WORK WITH NASA COLLABORATORS TO DESIGN AND FABRICATE CARBON NANOTUBE COATED LYOT STOPS FOR THE VISIBLE NULLING CORONAGRAPH (VNC) TEST BED, ALSO OF KEY IMPORTANCE TO THE DECADAL MISSIONS REFERENCED ABOVE. LASTLY, WE PLAN TO COLLABORATE WITH THE LISA TELESCOPE TEAM AT NASA GSFC TO DESIGN AND FABRICATE A CARBON NANOTUBE APODIZATION MASK ON A POWERED SECONDARY MIRROR THAT COULD BE USED IN SINGLE CRYSTAL SILICON TELESCOPE AS A PATHFINDER FOR LISA. ONE OF THE TECHNICAL GOALS OF PHASE II ARE TO PATTERN MORE COMPLEX LYOT STOP GEOMETRIES WHILE MAINTAINING GEOMETRICAL ACCURACY THROUGH THE NANOTUBE GROWTH PROCESS. FURTHER OPTIMIZATION OF THE APODIZATION MASKS FOR CORONAGRAHIC USE INCLUDE: 1) INCREASING THE METALLIC COATING REFLECTANCE TO NEAR IDEAL 2) OPTIMIZATION OF THE NANOTUBE DARKNESS ON THE METALLIC COATINGS 3) GREYSCALE PATTERNING OF CARBON NANOTUBES AND MEDIUM REFLECTANCE COATINGS ON THE MIRRORS TO ACHIEVE ENHANCED DIFFRACTION SUPPRESSION. FOR THE LISA TELESCOPE DIFFRACTION SPOILER APPLICATION WE WILL DEMONSTRATE PATTERNING AND GROWTH OF CARBON NANOTUBES AT THE MICRON SCALE WHICH WHEN COMBINED WITH METALLIC NANOSTRUCTURES CAN PROVIDE ENHANCED FIELD SUPPRESSION; ANOTHER ENABLING TECHNOLOGY TO NASA MISSIONS."

OUR SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF HELDENSURFACE, WHICH IS A ROBUST TOOL FOR AUTOMATIALLY CONVERTING ARBITRARY STARTING GEOMETRY DEFINITIONS INTO A COLLECTION OF WATERTIGHT CAD SURFACES. THESE CAD SURFACES ARE THEN USED AS THE STARTING POINT FOR EXISTING COMMERCIAL GRID GENERATORS SUCH AS OUR HELDENMESH UNSTRUCTURED GRID GENERATOR. THIS REPRESENTS A CRITICAL CAPABILITY NEEDED TO AUTOMATE THE CFD MESH GENERATION PROCESS   PERMITTING THE THOUSANDS OF ENGINEERS PERFORMING CFD TO FOCUS THEIR EFFORTS ON INTERPRETING RESULTS INSTEAD OF GENERATING MESHES. THE FEASIBILITY OF HELDENSURFACE WAS PROVEN DURING OUR PHASE I EFFORT THROUGH ITS SUCCESSFUL DEMONSTRATION ON MULTIPLE TEST CASES. OUR PHASE II EFFORT BUILDS UPON THIS PAST SUCCESS BY FOCUSING ON ITS FURTHER DEVELOPMENT AND DEMONSTRATION, TESTING, AND COMPLETION OF COMMERCIALIZATION ASSESSMENTS. WE OFFER A PROVEN PATH TO COMMERCIALIZATION OF HELDENSURFACE BY LEVERAGING OUR CURRENT SUCCESS WITH THE COMMERCIALIZATION OF OUR HELDENMESH GRID GENERATION SOFTWARE AND WE ANTICIPATE OFFERING HELDENSURFACE AS A COMMERCIAL PRODUCT WITHIN 2 YEARS OF COMPLETION OF THE PHASE II EFFORT."

TO MEET THIS NEED WE WILL BUILD A RELIABLE FINE TRACKING SENSOR FOR KNOWING WHERE NEARBY OBJECTS ARE LOCATED AND AN EARLY WARNING SENSOR FOR THE REGION OUTSIDE THE COVERAGE OF THE FINE TRACKER. THE FIRST STEP IS TO SUBSTANTIALLY IMPROVE THE CANDIDATE SENSOR TECHNOLOGIES [RADAR, LIDAR AND V2V] FOR OUR SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS. THIS IS BECAUSE THE INDIVIDUAL TECHNOLOGIES HAVE TYPICALLY BEEN DESIGNED FOR OTHER MARKETS AND ON THEIR OWN WILL NOT SOLVE SENSE AND AVOID. BUT THE COMBINATION OF OUR IMPROVEMENTS TO THESE THREE TECHNOLOGIES ALONG WITH SMART DATA FUSION WILL PROVIDE MEANINGFUL EARLY WARNING AND FINE TRACKING OF ANY LIKELY INTRUDERS.

ISRU IS ALSO VIEWED BY COMMERCIAL SPACE COMPANIES AS A SIGNIFICANT SOURCE OF REVENUE; VOLATILES (MAINLY WATER) COULD BE MINED AND SOLD AS HYDROGEN/OXYGEN FUEL TO SATELLITE OPERATORS TO EXTEND SPACECRAFT LIFE. TRADITIONAL ISRU ARCHITECTURE FOLLOWS METHODS EMPLOYED IN THE MINING INDUSTRY ON EARTH: MATERIAL IS MINED, CRUSHED, TRANSPORTED, CRUSHED AGAIN, PROCESSED, AND WASTE IS DISPOSED OF. HOWEVER, MINING CONCRETE-HARD ICE AND ICY-SOIL IS DIFFICULT WITHOUT USING EXPLOSIVES. VOLATILES WILL GET LOST DURING CRUSHING AND TRANSPORTATION, AND ROBOTIC MATERIAL HANDLING, AS SHOWN BY THE 2008 MARS PHOENIX MISSION, IS DIFFICULT. FOR THESE REASONS, WE PROPOSE THE PLANETARY VOLATILES EXTRACTOR (PVEX) CORER, WHICH USES A DRILL BASED EXCAVATION APPROACH AND AN INTEGRATED VOLATILES EXTRACTION PLANT. PVEX SUCCESSFULLY ADDRESSES SEVERAL ASPECTS: DRILLS CAN PENETRATE HARD MATERIALS, THERE IS NO NEED FOR MATERIAL CRUSHING AND TRANSFER, IF VOLATILES SUBLIME, THEY WILL FLOW DIRECTLY INTO THE CAPTURE SYSTEM.

      "description": "IGF::OT::IGFTHIS CONTRACT IS A RESULT OF A DOWNSELECT FROM AWARDS ISSUED AS A RESULT OF NNH15ZDA001N-S3GSI.  A SUMMARY OF THE RESEARCH IS AS FOLLOWS:  FUTURE ROBOTIC MISSIONS TO VENUS REQUIRE ACTUATORS FOR POWERING ROBOTIC ARMS, SAMPLING SYSTEMS, AND GIMBALS FOR THE POSITIONING OF CAMERAS AND ANTENNAS. THERE ARE MANY TYPES OF ACTUATORS (E.G. PNEUMATIC, HYDRAULIC); HOWEVER ELECTRIC ACTUATORS OFFER THE GREATEST VERSATILITY FOR SPACE MISSIONS. AN ELECTRIC ACTUATOR CONSISTS OF AN ELECTRIC MOTOR AND A POSITION SENSOR. THE ELECTRIC MOTOR CONVERTS ELECTRICAL ENERGY (ELECTRICITY) INTO MECHANICAL OUTPUT (SHAFT ROTATION). THE POSITION SENSOR, ON THE OTHER HAND, DETERMINES THE ANGULAR POSITION OF THE MOTOR SHAFT, WHICH THEN IS PROCESSED BY DRIVE ELECTRONICS TO COMMUTATE AND CONTROL THE MOTOR.  BECAUSE OF THE EXTREME CONDITIONS ON THE VENUS SURFACE (92 BAR PRESSURE, 462 C TEMPERATURE, AND SUPERCRITICAL CO2 ATMOSPHERE), CONVENTIONAL ACTUATORS WILL NOT BE ABLE TO FUNCTION PROPERLY, OR AT ALL. THE MAIN CHALLENGES PERTAIN TO CHANGES IN ELECTRICAL PROPERTIES LIKE AN INCREASE IN WIRE RESISTANCE (LEADING TO GREATER LOSSES), CHANGES IN MAGNETIC PROPERTIES LIKE PERMEABILITY AND RETENTIVITY (LEADING TO DEMAGNETIZATION OF MAGNETS), AND CHANGES IN PHYSICAL PROPERTIES SUCH AS LINEAR EXPANSION, DECREASE IN STRENGTH, INCREASE IN FRICTION, AND ACCELERATED OXIDATION.  HONEYBEE HAS DEVELOPED A 48V BRUSHLESS DC MOTOR (BLDC) AND CUSTOM POSITION SENSOR CALLED THE PULSED INJECTION POSITION SENSOR (PIPS) FOR MOTOR COMMUTATION AND FEEDBACK CONTROL. THE MOTOR AND PIPS ARE AT TECHNOLOGY READINESS LEVEL (TRL) 5. THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THE PROPOSED WORK IS TO MATURE THE VENUS ACTUATOR TECHNOLOGY THROUGH AN ITERATIVE PROCESS OF VENUS CHAMBER TESTING OF A TRL5 ACTUATOR, FOLLOWED BY RE-DESIGN AND FABRICATION OF A TRL6 ACTUATOR AND SUBSEQUENT VENUS CHAMBER QUALIFICATION TESTING OF THAT ACTUATOR. THE CRITICAL OBJECTIVES TO BE MET ARE AS FOLLOWS: 1. DESIGN OF A MOTOR WITH 28V WINDINGS, 2. INCREASE PIPS RESOLUTION (THIS WILL MAKE MOTOR MORE EFFICIENT AND ALLOW ACTUATOR TO BE USED FOR PRECISION POSITIONING SYSTEMS ROBOTIC ARMS AND GIMBALS), 3. ESTABLISH REPRODUCIBLE PROCEDURES, STANDARDS, AND GUIDELINES FOR FABRICATING, ASSEMBLY, TEST, AND INSPECTION OF VENUS ACTUATORS (CURRENTLY ACTUATORS ARE HAND CRAFTED BY SELECTED ENGINEERS THIS KNOWLEDGE NEEDS TO BE CAPTURED SO THAT ANY SKILLED PERSON WILL BE ABLE TO FABRICATE VENUS ACTUATOR WHENEVER NEEDED). THIS EFFORT WILL BE ACHIEVED IN ONE YEAR PERIOD TO ENABLE TECHNOLOGY INFUSION INTO THE NEW FRONTIERS (NF) VENUS IN SITU EXPLORER (VISE) MISSION."

      "description": "REDWATER COMBINES THE TWO TECHNOLOGIES INTO ONE: IT USES THE CT APPROACH TO CREATE A HOLE(FIGURE 1). ONCE THE HOLE IS MADE, THE COILED TUBING IS LEFT IN THE HOLE AND USED AS CONDUIT FORWATER EXTRACTION. THE BHA CONTAINS A ROTARY-PERCUSSIVE DRILL SUBSYSTEM (SIMILAR TO THE ONE USEDIN HONEYBEE ROBOTICS DEEP DRILL3), A DOWNHOLE PUMP, AND HEATERS. THE TUBE HOUSES AN INSULATEDAND HEATED HOSE AS WELL AS WIRES FOR DOWNHOLE MOTORS AND HEATERS. DURING DRILLING, COMPRESSEDGAS IS SEND DOWNHOLE THROUGH THE HOSE. THE GAS ESCAPES THROUGH THE ANNUAL SPACE BETWEEN THETUBE AND BOREHOLE WALL AND REMOVES CHIPS THAT CAN BE COLLECTED AND ANALYZED FOR SCIENCE. UPONREACHING AN ICE LAYER, THE DRILL CONTINUES FOR ANOTHER 3 M AND THEN STOPS ADVANCING FORWARD, BUTTHE BIT CONTINUOUS SPINNING. HEATERS ARE TURNED ON TO MELT THE SURROUNDING ICE. ONCE ICE STARTS TOMELT, THE PERISTALTIC PUMP STARTS PUMPING A FRACTION OF THE MELTED WATER UP THE SAME HOSE THATWAS USED FOR THE COMPRESSED GAS, AND INTO A STORAGE TANK ON THE SURFACE VIA A 3-WAY HEATED VALVE(VALVE SWITCHES BETWEEN THE GAS TANK AND WATER TANK). THE REMAINING WATER PASSES THROUGH ADOWNHOLE HEATER AND IS PUMPED INTO THE ROTATING BIT FOR WATER JETTING THIS CONTINUOUS STIRRING OFWATER AND INJECTION OF HOT WATER SPEEDS UP THE MELTING PROCESS. AFTER MELTING A SECTION OF ICE, THECT IS REACTIVATED TO DRILL FURTHER AND THE MELTING PROCESS CONTINUES.SINCE ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE AT ARCADIA PLANITIA IS ABOVE THE TRIPLE POINT OF WATER, LIQUID WATER CANEXIST. HOWEVER, IT IS UNSTABLE AND CAN BOIL OFF VERY QUICKLY. FOR THIS REASON, IT WOULD BE DESIRABLETO SEAL OFF THE HOLE. THIS CAN BE ACHIEVED VIA ACTIVE MEANS (A PACKER CAN EXPAND IN A HOLE ANDSEAL THE ANNULAR SPACE BETWEEN THE TUBE AND THE BOREHOLE) OR PASSIVE MEANS (WATER VAPOR WOULDRE-CONDENSE ON THE COLD BOREHOLE WALL AND SEAL IT THIS IN FACT HAS BEEN OBSERVED). THE TUBE WOULDHAVE TO BE HEATED TO FREE ITSELF UP BEFORE CONTINUING FURTHER DOWN, WHEN NEEDED.OUR PNEUMATIC EXCAVATION TESTS AT 7 TORR SHOWED PENETRATION RATES OF 1 M/MIN IN REGOLITH4. THEMASS RATIO OF GAS USED TO MATERIAL REMOVED OUT OF THE HOLE WAS 1:500. ASSUMING A 5 CM DIAMETERHOLE (CURRENT BASELINE FOR REDWATER), THE REQUIRED MASS OF GAS WOULD BE 10 KG. MOST OF THESOURCES OF COMPRESSED GAS ARE AT HIGH TRL. GAS CAN BE BROUGHT FROM THE EARTH (MARS2020MISSION BRINGS A TANK OF COMPRESSED N2 TO BLOW DUST OFF ROCKS), HELIUM PRESSURANT CAN BE USEDFROM LANDED SYSTEMS, ROCKET FUEL CAN BE BURNED AND TURNED INTO GAS, AND ISRU GASSES (H2/O2)COULD ALSO BE USED. FINALLY, A COMPRESSOR COULD COMPRESS MARTIAN AIR. MOXI ON MARS2020 HAS ACOMPRESSOR THAT WOULD TAKE 100 HOURS TO COMPRESS 10 KG OF CO2 FROM 7 TORR TO 760 TORR.TO EXTRACT THE REQUIRED 16 TONS OF WATER, A POOL OF APPROXIMATELY 3.1 M IN DIAMETER HAS TO BECREATED, WHICH IS FEASIBLE. THE PROCESS OF WATER EXTRACTION WOULD TAKE SEVERAL WEEKS. OURTHERMAL MODELS USING MATHCAD AS WELL AS CALCULATIONS SHOW THAT REQUIRE HEAT FOR MELTING IS 1.5KW AND FOR KEEPING THE WATER HOSE WARM ALONG THE 25 M LENGTH IS 1 KW.

      "description": "OCEAN WORLDS AND MARS ARE OF PARTICULAR INTEREST TO ASTROBIOLOGY SINCE THEY COULD OFFER CLUES IN THE QUEST TO DISCOVER LIFE BEYOND OUR HOME PLANET. EUROPA HAS BEEN A PRIMARY TARGET IN THE SEARCH FOR PAST OR PRESENT LIFE BECAUSE IT IS STILL GEOLOGICALLY ACTIVE AND HAS A LARGE OCEAN UNDERNEATH AN ICE SHELL (DESPITE BEING SMALLER THAN OUR MOON, EUROPA HAS MORE WATER THAN EARTH). THEREFORE, WE WILL FOCUS TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT ON EUROPA. HOWEVER THE PROPOSED TECHNOLOGY (WITH VARIOUS DEGREE OF MODIFICATION) COULD ALSO BE USED ON OTHER OCEAN WORLDS AND MARS. TO ADVANCE FORWARD, A PROBE WOULD NEED TOÙÄÅáDESTROYÙÄÅá THE FORMATION AND MOVE THE DRILLED MATERIAL BEHIND IT. THIS CAN BE ACHIEVED VIA TWO PRIMARY METHODS: THERMAL AND MECHANICAL. EACH OF THESE TWO METHODS HAS UNIQUE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES BUT NEITHER IS SUFFICIENT TO REACH THE OCEAN. THERMAL PROBES (E.G. MELT PROBES, CLOSED CYCLE HOT WATER DRILLS - CCHWD, LASERS) ARE VERY ROBUST PENETRATORS THAT REQUIRE JUST HEAT TO MELT THROUGH AND ADVANCE DEEPER BELOW THE SURFACE. THERMAL PROBES, HOWEVER, ARE SLOW (ESPECIALLY IN CRYOGENIC ICE), REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF POWER (KW TO 10S OF KW, DEPENDING ON THE PROBEÙÄÅáS DIAMETER AND LENGTH), AND ARE INEFFICIENT, BECAUSE>90% OF THE HEAT IS LOST INTO SURROUNDING ICE. MECHANICAL DRILLING SYSTEMS, ON THE OTHER HAND, ARE APPROXIMATELY 100X MORE EFFICIENT AND SIGNIFICANTLY FASTER. FOR THAT REASON THEY ARE PRIMARY METHODS OF MAKING HOLES AND CAPTURING ICE CORES IN GREENLAND AND ANTARCTICA. THEY CAN ALSO PENETRATE MATERIALS OTHER THAN ICE (E.G. SALTS). THE MAJOR DRAWBACK OF THESE DRILLS RELATES TO CHIPS REMOVAL. CHIPS NEED TO BE REMOVED BY EITHER PERIODICALLY LIFTING THE DRILL WITH CHIPS BASKET OUT OF THE HOLE (CONVENTIONAL METHOD USED IN TERRESTRIAL ICE DRILLING) OR LIFTING THE CHIPS ABOVE THE PROBE AND RECOMPACTING THEM TO THEIR ORIGINAL DENSITY (E.G. INCH WORM APPROACH). IN SUMMARY, MECHANICAL SYSTEMS HAVE VERY EFFICIENT FORMATION BREAKING APPROACH WHILE THERMAL SYSTEMS HAVE VERY EFFECTIVE CHIPS REMOVAL APPROACH. SLUSH IS A THERMO-MECHANICAL PROBE THAT COMBINES THE BEST FROM THESE TWO TECHNIQUES: MECHANICAL DRILL TO BREAK THE FORMATION AND MELTING TO REMOVE THE CUTTINGS). HOWEVER, INSTEAD OF MELTING AN ENTIRE VOLUME OF ICE, SLUSH MELTS JUST A FRACTION OF IT TO FORM SLUSH. SLUSH BEHAVES LIKE LIQUID BUT IS STILL PARTIALLY FROZEN THIS ENABLES SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN POWER DRAW. SINCE MECHANICAL APPROACH GENERATES HIGHER PENETRATION RATES, SLUSH CAN ALSO REACH THE OCEAN IN MUCH SHORTER TIME. SLUSH LOOKS LIKE A TORPEDO WITH A DRILL BIT IN FRONT AND ANTI-TORQUE BLADES ON THE SIDE (PROVEN SYSTEM IN ANTARCTIC WIRELINE DRILLS). IT HOUSES SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS FOR IN-SITU ANALYSIS. IT IS CONNECTED TO A SURFACE LANDER BY AN UMBILICAL FOR DATA AND POWER. TO REDUCE POWER DRAW FROM THE SURFACE ENERGY SUPPLY NEEDED FOR PARTIAL MELTING, SLUSH INCORPORATES GENERAL PURPOSE HEAT SOURCEÙÄÅá BRICKS WITH #tilde#250 WATT THERMAL POWER. ONCE SLUSH PASSES THROUGH THE CRYOGENIC LICE (A FEW KM THICK), IT CAN USE JUST A THERMAL APPROACH TO MELT THROUGH THE WARMER ICE WITHOUT THE NEED FOR MECHANICAL CUTTING. THERMAL PROBES ARE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE EFFICIENT IN TEMPERED (WARM) ICE. UNDER PICASSO, THE TRL OF SLUSH WILL BE INCREASED FROM TRL2 TO TRL4. WE WOULD FOCUS ON TWO OF THE MOST CRITICAL TECHNICAL ASPECTS: DRILLING/MELTING AND CHIPS TRANSPORT. TO REACH TRL4, WE PROPOSE TO: 1. DEVELOP HIGH LEVEL DESIGNS AND THERMAL MODELS FOR CRYOGENIC AND WARM ICE TO ESTABLISH POWER LEVELS NEEDED FOR PARTIAL MELTING, AND CONSTRAIN PROBEÙÄÅáS DIAMETER AND LENGTH. 2. BREADBOARD CRITICAL SUBSYSTEMS THAT WILL SUPPORT TRL4 SLUSH DESIGN. 3. DESIGN AND BUILD TRL 4 SLUSH AND TEST IT IN OUR 5 M TALL FREEZER AND IN OUR 3.5 M TALL THERMAL VACUUM CHAMBER IN EUROPA ANALOG ICE. 4. UPDATE HIGH LEVEL SLUSH DESIGN BASED ON TEST DATA."

THIS, TOGETHER WITH HYPER TECH S CAPABILITY TO FABRICATE LONG PIECE-LENGTH (POTENTIALLY 60 KM) WIRES, IN TURN ENABLES LIGHTER SUPERCONDUCTING MOTORS/GENERATORS, ESSENTIAL COMPONENTS IN THE TURBOELECTRIC AIRCRAFT PROPULSION SYSTEM WITH HIGH POWER DENSITIES (OVER 10 KW/KG) AND HIGH EFFICIENCY SUPERCONDUCTING COMPONENTS ENVISIONED IN NEXT GENERATION AIR VEHICLE TECHNOLOGIES. TO THAT END, THIS PROPOSED SBIR PHASE II PROGRAM FOCUSES ON DEVELOPING MGB2 MULTIFILAMENT SUPERCONDUCTING CABLES WITH EXCEPTIONALLY LOW AC LOSSES (TARGETING A LOSS BUDGET OF 1 W/CM3) BECAUSE SUPERCONDUCTORS IN A CABLE FORM IS ARGUABLY THE ONLY EASILY-ACCOMPLISHED AND VIABLE WAY TO PUSH DOWN AC LOSSES WHILE RETAINING HIGH OPERATING CURRENT LEVELS IN THE STATOR COILS. TWO RECENT ADVANCEMENTS AT HYPER TECH GREATLY INCREASE THE ODDS OF SUCCESS IN DEVELOPING SUPERCONDUCTING CABLE TECHNOLOGY IN THE PHASE I: 1) THE DEVELOPMENT OF CUTTING-EDGE SUPERCONDUCTOR STRAND ARCHITECTURE DESIGNS WITH FINE FILAMENTS, SMALL TWIST PITCHES AND RESISTIVE COMPONENTS FOR REDUCING AC LOSSES AND 2) IMPROVED WIRE MANUFACTURING CAPABILITY TO FABRICATE MULTI-STRAND CABLES IN SIGNIFICANT LENGTH. A SECOND BENEFIT OF USING SUPERCONDUCTING CABLE TECHNOLOGY, BEYOND AC LOSS REDUCTION, IS THE MUCH LOWER HEAT LOAD PRODUCED OR ENABLED BY THE CONDUCTOR."

SYSTEMS THAT PROVIDE RECYCLED TREATED WATER ABOARD THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION, AND THAT WILL SUPPLY WATER ABOARD FUTURE SPACECRAFT, ARE INHERENTLY COMPLEX AND CAN BE SUSCEPTIBLE TO BIOFILM FORMATION AND MICROBIAL CONTAMINATION. FURTHER, IT HAS BEEN NOTED THAT PATHOGENICITY AND VIRULENCE OF MICROBES CAN INCREASE IN MICROGRAVITY ENVIRONMENTS. THESE FACTORS, ALONG WITH THE HIGH CONSEQUENCE OF SICKNESS IN THE REMOTE SPACE ENVIRONMENT, MAKE RAPID, RELIABLE METHODS OF DETECTING MICROBES AT LOW LEVELS A CRITICAL NEED. RAPID MICROBIOLOGICAL DETECTION SYSTEMS HAVE TAKEN DRAMATIC STEPS FORWARD IN THE LAST TWO DECADES AND TODAY DETECTION OF EVEN A SINGLE ORGANISM IS POSSIBLE IN LESS THAN ONE HOUR. UNFORTUNATELY, DEVELOPMENT OF RAPID DETECTION METHODS HAS FAR OUTPACED DEVELOPMENT OF SAMPLE CONCENTRATION AND PREPARATION TECHNIQUES, WHICH ARE NECESSARY TO ENABLE DETECTION OF LOW MICROBIAL CONCENTRATIONS IN DRINKING WATER. CURRENTLY, WITHOUT SAMPLE CONCENTRATION, RAPID DETECTION TECHNIQUES ALONE PRODUCE RESULTS THAT ARE HUNDREDS TO THOUSANDS OF TIMES LESS SENSITIVE THAN THE MINIMUM DESIRED DETECTION LIMIT FOR MICROBIAL WATER CONTAMINANTS. INNOVAPREP PROPOSES DEVELOPMENT OF A RAPID MICROBIAL CONCENTRATION SYSTEM DESIGNED FOR USE ABOARD THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION. THE SYSTEM WILL CONCENTRATE MICROBES FROM UP TO 5 LITERS OF POTABLE WATER INTO VOLUMES AS SMALL AS 200 UL, PROVIDING CONCENTRATION FACTORS AS HIGH AS 15,000X. IT WILL BE BASED ON TECHNOLOGIES DEVELOPED AND COMMERCIALIZED BY INNOVAPREP, BUT WILL CONTAIN INNOVATIONS TO ALLOW FOR OPERATION IN MICROGRAVITY. LARGE VOLUMES OF POTABLE WATER ARE PROCESSED THROUGH A HOLLOW FIBER MEMBRANE FILTER CONCENTRATION CELL AS MICROBES ARE CAPTURED WITHIN THE LUMEN OF THE FIBERS. FOLLOWING CAPTURE, THE MICROBES ARE EFFICIENTLY ELUTED USING A NOVEL WET FOAM ELUTION PROCESS AND THEN DELIVERED TO A RAPID DETECTION SYSTEM FOR ANALYSIS."

HYDROGEN FIRE DETECTION IS CRITICAL FOR ROCKET PROPULSION SAFETY AND MAINTENANCE. A SIGNIFICANT FIRE AT A ROCKET TEST OR LAUNCH FACILITY COULD BE CATASTROPHIC TO INFRASTRUCTURE OR EVEN WORSE, TO HUMAN LIFE. DETECTION MONITORING IS PROBLEMATIC AS HYDROGEN FLAMES CAN BE NEARLY INVISIBLE DURING THE DAY. NON-IMAGING, NON-VISIBLE FIRE DETECTION TECHNOLOGY HAS LIMITED RANGE AND CAN SUFFER FROM FALSE ALARMS FROM SOURCES OUTSIDE THE REGION OF INTEREST. LOW-COST VISIBLE IMAGERS, COMMONLY USED FOR WIDE-SCALE ROUTINE SURVEILLANCE, HAVE LIMITED UTILITY DETECTING HYDROGEN FIRES. ALTHOUGH IT HAS BEEN KNOWN FOR DECADES THAT MULTISPECTRAL IMAGING OUTSIDE THE VISIBLE RANGE CAN BE USED TO DETECT FIRES WITH LOW FALSE ALARM RATES, THE PRICE OF SUCH SYSTEMS AND THE LACK OF PROCESSING ALGORITHMS AND ABILITY TO IMPLEMENT THEM IN REAL-TIME HAS LARGELY PROHIBITED THEIR USE. DURING THIS PROJECT WE WILL DEVELOP A LOW-COST IMAGING CAPABILITY THAT FUSES DATA COLLECTED FROM SENSORS OPERATING IN THE (1) SOLAR BLIND ULTRA-VIOLET, (2) THERMAL INFRARED, (3) MID-WAVE INFRARED, AND (4) VISIBLE SPECTRUM, USING ADVANCED SPECTRAL, SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL PROCESSING TECHNIQUES OPTIMIZED TO DETECT AND GENERATE ALERTS ASSOCIATED WITH HYDROGEN FIRES IN REAL-TIME. THIS MULTI-SENSOR, MULTI-PROCESSING APPROACH WILL ENABLE US TO AUTOMATE FLAME DETECTION WITH EXTREMELY LOW FALSE ALARM RATES.

THE EPI MATERIALS WILL BE GROWN WITH SB-CAPABLE MULTI-WAFER PRODUCTION MOLECULAR BEAM EPITAXY (MBE) REACTOR AT INTELLIEPI IR. THE INITIAL GOAL INCLUDES ACHIEVING QE OF AT LEAST 40% WITH LWIR SPECTRAL WAVELENGTH BAND NEAR 12 UM. THE SLS DETECTOR DESIGN WILL BE DEVELOPED IN CONSULTATION WITH THE INFRARED DETECTOR GROUP AT JPL TO ENSURE THAT THIS EFFORT ADDRESSES NASA NEEDS. IN THE SUPERLATTICE ENGINEERED STRUCTURE, MANY DETECTOR PROPERTIES ARE DETERMINED ONCE EPITAXIAL GROWTH IS COMPLETED. THE TECHNICAL APPROACH WILL BE TO DEVELOP IMPROVED EPITAXIAL STACK DESIGN WITH A GOAL TO DRAMATICALLY IMPROVE DETECTOR PROPERTIES. THIS IS BASED ON EXISTING HIGH PERFORMANCE GASB-BASED TYPE-II SLS DETECTOR GROWTH TECHNOLOGY, WITH NOVEL DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT OF MBE GROWTH TO IMPLEMENT THE DESIGN, AND FABRICATION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF DEVICES FROM THE EPI GROWN MATERIAL. THE OBJECTIVE IS TO DRAMATICALLY IMPROVE QUANTUM EFFICIENCY IN THE DETECTOR STRUCTURE. THE PHAQSE II EFFORT WILL FOCUS ON FPA DEMONSTRATION."

THE PROPOSED GYROSCOPE IS BASED ON AN INNOVATIVE APPROACH USING PHOTONIC CRYSTAL FIBER (PCF) COILS THAT REDUCES THE MAJOR GYRO ERROR SOURCES AND ENABLES A RADIATION HARD SENSOR IN SMALLER VOLUME COMPARED TO STATE-OF-THE-ART. PHASE 1 ADDRESSED THE FEASIBILITY OF THE PCF FOG CONCEPT, DEMONSTRATION OF CRITICAL COMPONENTS, PERFORMANCE/SIZE TRADEOFFS, AND PRELIMINARY DESIGNS OF FOG-BASED IRU AND IMU, LEADING TO A PROTOTYPE GYRO TO BE DESIGNED AND BUILT IN PHASE 2. IN PARTICULAR, PHASE 1 INVOLVED A COMPREHENSIVE STUDY OF AVAILABLE STATE-OF-THE-ART PCF AND ASSOCIATED COMPONENTS. BASED ON THIS, THREE DIFFERENT PCFS WERE OBTAINED AND EXTENSIVELY TESTED FOR SUITABILITY IN SMALL GYRO APPLICATIONS EMPHASIZING TIGHT BENDING DIAMETERS AND TEMPERATURE TESTS. THE TESTS DEMONSTRATED THAT THE TECHNOLOGY IS SUFFICIENTLY DEVELOPED TO ENABLE IMPLEMENTATION OF ADVANCED PCF-BASED FOGS IN THE NEAR FUTURE. PHASE 2 WILL (1) IMPLEMENT SELECTED PCF FOR THE GYRO APPLICATION, DEVELOP AND EVALUATE COMPONENTS INCLUDING THE PCF COIL, MODULATOR AND POLARIZERS, AND DEVELOP THE REQUIRED SUPPORT INFRASTRUCTURE AND TOOLING, (2) PERFORM PERFORMANCE MODELING AND TRADE-OFFS FOLLOWED BY A COMPLETE PCF GYRO DESIGN, (3) EVALUATE LOW-POWER SOLUTIONS FOR THE LIGHT SOURCE AND ELECTRONICS AND PRELIMINARY VALUATION OF UNIQUE ELECTRONIC MINIATURIZATION DESIGNS, (4) DELIVER A TESTED AND VALIDATED GYRO SENSOR AND ELECTRONICS, AND (5) DESIGN A COMPACT OPEN-LOOP PCF FOG-BASED 3-AXIS IRU SYSTEM.

IN OUR PHASE I PROJECT WE HAVE DEMONSTRATED THE FEASIBILITY OF FILLING THIS GAP BY APPLYING LASER ULTRASONIC TESTING (LUT) FOR NONDESTRUCTIVE EVALUATION OF EACH AM DEPOSITED LAYER IN REAL TIME AS IT IS FORMED. THIS IN-LINE INSPECTION QUALIFIES THE PART LAYER-BY-LAYER, DIRECTS DEFECT REMOVAL DURING THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS, AND ENSURES QUALIFIED FINISHED PARTS THAT REQUIRE NO FURTHER TESTING. IN THIS PROPOSED PHASE II PROJECT WE WILL TEAM WITH A MANUFACTURER OF POWDER BED FUSION AM MACHINES TO DEVELOP A THREE-STEP LAYER-BY-LAYER INSPECTION AND VALIDATION SYSTEM, CONSISTING OF: (1) OPTICAL PROFILOMETRY FOR DEFECT DETECTION, (2) LASER ABLATION TO REMOVE THE DEFECT INDICATIONS AND (3) LUT TO VALIDATE THE REMOVAL OF THE DEFECTS. THE IOS TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT WILL INCLUDE ADVANCED SIGNAL PROCESSING AND OPTIMIZED BEAM PARAMETERS FOR OPTIMIZED SIGNAL-TO-NOISE, AS WELL AS INTEGRATION OF THE CONTROLS WITH THE AM MACHINE CONTROLS. A PRELIMINARY AND A FULL-SCALE PROTOTYPE LUT SYSTEM WILL BE DEVELOPED AND TESTED ON THE MANUFACTURER S AM MACHINE. AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PROJECT WE WILL BE AT TRL 4; AT THE END OF THE PROJECT WE WILL BE AT TRL 6."

DURING SBIR PHASE I, INTELLIGENT OPTICAL SYSTEMS (IOS) DEMONSTRATED A PHASERESOLVED LUMINESCENT SILVER MONITOR THAT RELIES ON USING A CHELATION AGENT FOR SENSOR REVERSIBILITY. IT WAS FOUND THAT A WASHING STEP USING L-GLUTATHIONE EFFECTIVELY RETURNED THE SENSOR SIGNAL TO BASELINE, BUT A WASHING STEP IS NOT FEASIBLE FOR CONTINUOUS MEASUREMENT. THE REQUIREMENT FOR USING A CHELATION AGENT FOR SENSOR REVERSIBILITY WAS IDENTIFIED AS A KEY RISK OF USING THIS TECHNOLOGY AND GREATLY AFFECTED ITS FEASIBILITY FOR SPACEFLIGHT APPLICATIONS. IOS HAS SINCE IDENTIFIED MULTIPLE POTENTIAL STRATEGIES FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF A REVERSIBLE SENSOR THAT DOES NOT REQUIRE A CHELATION STEP, ALL OF WHICH ARE COMPATIBLE WITH PHASE-RESOLVED LUMINESCENCE TECHNOLOGY. THIS WORK IS A FIRST STEP IN DETERMINING THE FEASIBILITY OF THE PROPOSED STRATEGIES."

SPACESUIT DEVELOPMENT AND GROUND-BASED TESTING REQUIRE SENSING AND ANALYTICAL INSTRUMENTATION FOR CHARACTERIZING AND VALIDATING PROTOTYPES. WHILE MINIATURE THERMOSENSORS MEASURE RELIABLY AT LOW COST, AND CAN BE INCORPORATED ALL AROUND SPACESUIT PROTOTYPES, INCORPORATING GAS SENSORS AT LOCATIONS OF INTEREST INSIDE A SPACESUIT HAS BEEN A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE   IN PARTICULAR FOR HUMAN SUBJECT TESTS   BECAUSE OF THE SIZE AND COST OF AVAILABLE INSTRUMENTATION. THE SENSOR PROBES AND CABLES MUST NOT RESTRICT THE SUIT OR HUMAN SUBJECTS'' MOBILITY, AND MUST NOT DISTURB THE GAS FLOW. INTELLIGENT OPTICAL SYSTEM IS DEVELOPING LUMINESCENCE-BASED SENSING PATCHES FOR NON-INTRUSIVE MONITORING OF CRITICAL LIFE SUPPORT GAS CONSTITUENTS AND POTENTIAL TRACE CONTAMINANTS IN SPACESUITS. FLEXIBLE SENSITIVE PATCHES INSIDE PROTOTYPE SPACESUITS ARE INTERROGATED VIA OPTICAL FIBERS, AND DO NOT DISTURB THE GAS FLOW OR THE HUMAN SUBJECT. THIS WILL GIVE SUIT ENGINEERS GREAT FLEXIBILITY FOR CHOOSING MULTIPLE SENSING POINTS, FITTING THE SENSOR ELEMENTS INTO THE SPACESUIT, AND COST EFFECTIVELY RELOCATING THE SENSOR ELEMENTS AS DESIRED. IN PHASE I, A FIRST DEMONSTRATOR WAS VALIDATED AT JOHNSON SPACE CENTER BY COMPARISON WITH CURRENT INSTRUMENTATION USED IN THE SUITED MANIKIN TEST APPARATUS.

SVGS WAS DEPLOYED AND TESTED ON A PLATFORM EQUIVALENT TO THE GUEST SCIENTIST MODULE (HLP) ON ASTROBEE, WHICH FACILITATES DIRECT DEPLOYMENT OF SVGS ON ASTROBEE WITH MINIMAL ADDITIONAL HARDWARE.

GROUND TESTING OF THE RINGS-ASTROBEE ASSEMBLY WILL INCLUDING FORMATION FLIGHT IN BOTH OPEN AND CLOSED LOOP MANEUVERS. RINGS IS CURRENTLY UNUTILIZED ON BOARD ISS. THE RINGS SCIENCE MISSIONS ARE AN IMPORTANT STEP TO DEMONSTRATE AND ASSESS THE FEASIBILITY OF ELECTROMAGNETIC FORMATION FLIGHT AND WIRELESS POWER TRANSFER.

THE PROPOSED PHASE II WILL ALSO HELP DEMONSTRATE AND ASSESS SVGS AS STAND-ALONE SENSOR FOR PROXIMITY OPERATIONS BETWEEN SMALL SATELLITES. SVGS IS AN ATTRACTIVE ALTERNATIVE AS REAL-TIME SENSOR FOR RENDEZVOUS, DOCKING AND PROXIMITY OPERATIONS. KEY FACTORS THAT MAKE SVGS ATTRACTIVE TO SMALL SATELLITE APPLICATIONS (SMALL FORM FACTOR, LOW COST, PLATFORM INDEPENDENCE) ALSO MAKES IT APPEALING TO HUMAN EXPLORATION MISSIONS, WHERE CREW VEHICLES NEED TO DOCK WITH A VARIETY OF PLATFORMS. THE NICHE FOR A PROXIMITY OPERATIONS SENSOR FOR SMALLSAT APPLICATIONS IS CURRENTLY OPEN   THE DEPLOYMENT OF SVGS ON ISS AND ITS APPLICATION TO COMPLETE THE RINGS MISSION WILL ILLUSTRATE SVGS  ABILITY TO FILL THAT ROLE."

THE FREE FORM MDDM AM PROCESS WAS MATURED BY KEYSTONE UNDER AN ONR SPONSORED SBIR PROJECT [4]. FURTHER REFINEMENT OCCURRED UNDER KEYSTONE IR&DEFFORTS WHICH DEMONSTRATED THE ABILITY TO DIRECTLY DEPOSIT A FREE FORM NOZZLE LINER. KEYSTONE IS PROPOSING LOW COST METHODS TO SUBSEQUENTLY INTRODUCE COOLANT CHANNELS, FOLLOWED BY A HYBRID MDDM AM TO CLOSE-OUT THE UNFILLED COOLANT CHANNELS, AND CONTINUE TO BUILD THE STRUCTURAL JACKET AND MANIFOLDS USING NICKEL BASED SUPER ALLOYS (HOWEVER, AUSTENITIC STAINLESS STEEL ALLOYS COULD BE EQUALLY APPLICABLE). MORE SPECIFICALLY, THE PHASE II PROJECT WILL FOCUS ON MATURING THE CAPABILITY TO BUILD NICKEL BASED SUPERALLOY(OR STAINLESS STEEL ALLOYS) NOZZLE LINERS, INCORPORATE AND CLOSE-OUT COOLANT CHANNELS, AND BUILD A STRUCTURAL JACKETWITH MANIFOLDS UTILIZING A HYBRID MDDM PROCESS. THE HYBRID MDDM PROCESS IS BASED ON ROBOTIC, CLOSEDLOOP CONTROLLED, WIRE FED METHODS USING EITHER A LASER OR PULSED-ARC TO BUILD THE LAYERS INTO THE DESIGN CONFIGURATION WITH FUNCTIONALITY. THE KEYSTONE MDDM PROCESS UTILIZES A UNIQUE SET OF IN-PROCESS SENSORS TO ENABLE THE CLOSED-LOOP PROCESS CONTROL OF THE TEMPERATURE AND HENCE THE PROPERTIES AND DIMENSIONS. THE INPROCESS SENSOR PACKAGE AND FEEDBACK MONITORING CAPABILITY ENABLES MEASUREMENT AND CONTROL OF THE KEY PROCESS CHARACTERISTICS FORMING THE MELT POOL DURING THE DEPOSIT AS WELL AS REAL TIME MONITORING TO ENSURE THE AM PROCESS REMAINS WITHIN DESIRED PROCESS CONTROL WINDOWS."

BASED ON AN ACOUSTO-OPTIC ILLUMINATION ENGINE, SLIM CONSUMES ONLY 10-20W OF POWER, WEIGHS LESS THAN A KILOGRAM, COULD FIT IN A SHIRT POCKET, AND USES SPACE-PROVEN COMPONENTS WITHOUT MOVING PARTS TO RAPIDLY GENERATE AND PRECISELY CONTROL LASER ILLUMINATION PATTERNS. THROUGH MODIFICATIONS OF SLIM HARDWARE AND ALGORITHMS, MARVIN ENABLES TRIANGULATION-BASED WIDE-FIELD ACTIVE 3D IMAGING OF NEARBY SCENES WITH MM-SCALE RESOLUTION AT DISTANCES UP TO 10M EVEN IN THE PRESENCE OF FULL SUNLIGHT, AS WELL AS MULTI-BEAM TIME-OF-FLIGHT (TOF) CM-RESOLUTION RANGING AND DOPPLER VELOCIMETRY AT DISTANCES OF HUNDREDS OF METERS, OR POTENTIALLY EVEN FURTHER.  MARVIN CAN SWITCH BETWEEN THE TWO MODES SIMPLY BY MOVING A LENS. MARVIN COMPUTES EACH RANGE POINT IN PARALLEL AND INDEPENDENTLY, IS ROBUST ACROSS A WIDE RANGE OF AMBIENT LIGHTING, TEXTURES, AND ALBEDOS, AND IS COMPUTATIONALLY SIMPLE, INCREASING ROVER AUTONOMY, EVEN IN LOW LIGHT, AND REDUCING TRAVERSE AND SCIENCE OPERATION DOWN-TIMES.  MARVIN S LOW-SWAP AND AGILITY ALSO BENEFIT EDL, STATION KEEPING, TERRAIN MAPPING, AND PROXIMITY OPERATIONS.  MARVIN COULD BE USED AS A FASTER, MORE ROBUST, HIGH-PRECISION PRIMARY RANGE SENSOR FOR EXPLORATION OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM, INCLUDING MARS, THE MOON, OCEAN WORLDS, AND ASTEROIDS. THE PHASE I EFFORT INCLUDED FEASIBILITY AND BENEFIT STUDIES, SIMULATIONS AND ALGORITHM DEVELOPMENT, NOISE AND PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS, A PROOF-OF-CONCEPT LAB DEMONSTRATION OF MANY-BEAM MARVIN RANGING, AND AN OPTOMECHANICAL DESIGN, BRINGING MARVIN TO TRL3.  THE PHASE II EFFORT AIMS TO ADVANCE THIS DESIGN, DEVELOP REQUISITE ELECTRONICS, IMPLEMENT A MARVIN PROTOTYPE, AND TEST IT ON THE MAST OF A JPL ROVER, ADVANCING MARVIN FROM TRL3 TO TRL4."

THE PROPOSAL TAKES WORK PERFORMED BY THE SBC UNDER IR&D WHICH HAS PERFORMED DETAILED HYDROCODE MODELING OF A NTP IMPACTING AN UNYIELDING SURFACE FROM HEIGHTS OF 50 AND 150 METERS. TO INITIATE THE EFFORT, IT IS IMPORTANT TO START WITH SIMPLE COMPACTION MODEL, WHICH WAS ACCOMPLISHED IN PHASE I WITH THE TAYLOR IMPACT SIMULATION. INSTEAD OF A SINGLE NEUTRONICS CODE, LPS DEMONSTRATED VIABILITY WITH THREE CODES TO BETTER INSURE RELIABLE RESULTS. PHASE II WILL EXTEND THIS WORK. IT WILL CONTINUE TO UPDATE THE SCCTE-2 NTR DESIGN AND INCLUDE ANY DESIGN MODIFICATIONS BY NASA CONTRACTORS. THE NTR MODEL WILL BE UPDATED TO INCLUDE IMPORTANT PERIPHERALS SUCHS AS TURBOOO PUMP ASSEMBLIES, THRUST VECTOR CONTROL HARDWARE, PLUMBING AND A PROPELLANT TANK. THESE ARE ESSENTIAL ITEMS FOR A MORE REALISTIC IMPACT SCENARIO. FURTHER, DURING PHASE I, LPS DETERMINED THERE ARE A NUMBER OF MATERIALS WHOSE MECHANICAL DATABASE IS INSUFFICIENT FOR UNAMBIGUOUS HYDROCODE SIMULATIONS. LPS WILL DELIVER A COMPRHENSIVE TEST PROGRAM PLAN, COSTS AND SCHEDULE TO RESOLVE THESE DEFICIENCIES. THE TECHNICAL READINESS WILL BE IMPROVED SO END TO END SOFTWARE ELEMENTS ARE IMPLEMENTED AND INTERFACED WITH EXISTING SYSTEM CONCEPTS."

      "description": "The Government is procuring the next-generation Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES) series to continue its mission through new requirements specified in the GOES-R Level I Requirements Document and Mission Requirements Document (MRD). The first satellite of this new series, designated as GOES-R, will provide the first major improvement in instrument technology since GOES-I launched in 1994. The GOES-R series will introduce other new technologies in both the Space and Ground Segments. These advances will improve the nation's ability to monitor and forecast weather and environmental phenomena with a significant increase in the number of products.  One of NOAA's principal missions is to provide forecasts and warnings for the United States, its territories, adjacent waters and ocean area for the protection of life and property and enhancement of the national economy. This mission requires the capability to acquire, process, and disseminate environmental data on an extensive spatial range (global, regional and local) on a variety of time scales. These data include, but are not limited to: global imagery; cloud and precipitation parameters; atmospheric profiles of temperature, moisture, winds, aerosols, and ozone; surface conditions concerning ice, snow and vegetation; ocean parameters and sea-surface temperature; and solar and in-situ space environment conditions.  The Statement of Work (SOW) defines those tasks to design, analyze, validate, develop, fabricate, assemble, integrate, test, verify, evaluate, deliver GOES-R series satellites and support launch and post launch, supply and maintain the Ground Support Equipment (GSE), and support the NOAA Satellite Operations Control Center (SOCC).  The Contractor shall provide the personnel, materials, facilities, and other resources to design, validate, fabricate, assemble, integrate, test, verify, and deliver GOES-R series satellites and provide pre-launch, launch, and post-launch support and training under the basic contract, and options when exercised by the Government."

PREVIOUS SBIR PROGRAMS WITH NASA JPL HAVE DEMONSTRATED THE CAPABILITIES OF A 50M TETHER TO IDENTIFY A SNAG LOCATION WITH JPL S AXEL ROVER, AND PROVED THE FEASIBILITY OF FUTURE MINIATURIZATION OF THE TETHER S ACQUISITION SYSTEM. DURING THIS MULTIPHASE EFFORT, LUNA IS BUILDING UPON THESE SUCCESSES TO EXTEND THE SENSING LENGTH TO 1000M, TO ENABLE NASA TO PURSUE MORE COMPLEX EXPLORATION MISSIONS, SUCH AS NAVIGATING A LARGE CRATER TO STUDY FEATURES ON THE CRATER WALL. DURING PHASE I, LUNA DEMONSTRATED THE FEASIBILITY OF SENSING TENSION UP TO 800M, AND CURVATURE UP TO 400M, AND ADDED A SPOT SCAN MODE TO ENABLE FAST UPDATE RATES OVER A SHORT SECTION OF THE TETHER. IN ADDITION TO INCREASING THE SENSING LENGTH FOR CURVATURE MEASUREMENTS, DURING THIS PHASE II LUNA WILL INCREASE THE SYSTEM ROBUSTNESS AND DELIVER A PROTOTYPE ACQUISITION SYSTEM, 1000M EXTENDED LENGTH TETHER, AND A SHORTER 50M TETHER FOR TESTING AT JPL."

IN PHASE I, ENGINEERS AT LUNA DEMONSTRATED A COMPREHENSIVE SYSTEM THAT INCLUDED FACILE SURFACE PREPARATION, SINGLE BAG OUT OF AUTOCLAVE PROCESSING AND LUNAS UNIQUE FIBER OPTIC MEASUREMENT CAPABILITY FOR MONITORING REPAIR STATE. THIS PHASE II PROGRAM WILL FOCUS ON OPTIMIZING THESE METHODS FOR LAUNCH VEHICLE COMPOSITE DAMAGE THAT CAN BE PERFORMED DURING GROUND PROCESSING OF THE LAUNCH VEHICLE WITHOUT THE NEED FOR FULL REPLACEMENT.

AT SMALLER SCALES (1-2 M2), THE ARCHITECTURE ALLOWS CONTINUOUS REFLECTOR SURFACES FOR ESPA-CLASS SPACECRAFT, WHILE AT LARGER SCALES A MODULAR ARCHITECTURE IS TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF TO PRODUCE MUCH LARGER APERTURES WITHOUT REQUIRING COMPARATIVELY LARGE SPACECRAFT. THE EFFORT WILL DEVELOP A LARGE APERTURE AT KU, KA, AND W FREQUENCIES USING ROLLABLE SHELL SURFACES THAT COMBINE THE SURFACE ACCURACY OF RIGID REFLECTORS WITH THE PACKAGING ADVANTAGES OF FLEXIBLE REFLECTORS. DEVELOPING A STOWABLE,  MORPHING , HIGH-STRAIN COMPOSITE REFLECTOR SURFACE WITH SUFFICIENT SURFACE ROUGHNESS AND POSITION KNOWLEDGE FOR FREQUENCIES UP TO 94 GHZ WILL ENABLE LARGE APERTURES WITH REDUCED STOWED ENVELOPE AND CAN DRAMATICALLY REDUCE THE HARDWARE, INSTRUMENT AND MISSION IMPLEMENTATION COSTS. ORIGINALLY INSPIRED BY THE SHAPE OF A BEAM BEING DEFLECTED UNDER LOAD, MMA IS USING ANALYSIS AND LAB TESTING TO DETERMINE THE PRESCRIBED LOADING CONFIGURATION CAPABLE OF DEFLECTING A SEMI-RIGID MEMBER INTO A PARABOLIC CURVE. BY USING THE MECHANICS OF BENDING RATHER THAN MOLDING AND MANUFACTURING TO PRESCRIBE THE REFLECTOR S SHAPE, THE SYSTEM PROVIDES A REPEATABLE METHOD OF FORMING A PARABOLIC SURFACE. THIS ARCHITECTURE LENDS ITSELF TO A STRUCTURALLY SIMPLE SYSTEM, PROVIDING HIGH RELIABILITY AND LOW COMPLEXITY. PHASE I EFFORTS DEMONSTRATED THROUGH ANALYSIS AND PROTOTYPING THAT LOADING CONDITIONS EXIST FOR ISOTROPIC BEAMS TO FORM A SURFACE CLOSELY MATCHING A PARABOLA, WHILE RF PERFORMANCE SIMULATIONS VERIFIED THE REFLECTOR S ABILITY TO PERFORM WITH MINIMAL GAIN LOSSES UP TO 95 GHZ. THE PHASE II EFFORT WILL BUILD UPON THIS EARLY DEVELOPMENT TO DESIGN, BUILD, AND TEST A DEPLOYABLE TRI-BAND ANTENNA SYSTEM."

THE HIGH QUALITY GAN/ALGAN UV-APD DETECTOR ARRAYS ARE EPITAXIALLY GROWN USING AN OPTIMIZED METAL ORGANIC CHEMICAL VAPOR DEPOSITION (MOCVD) TECHNIQUE. THE USE OF LATTICE-MATCHED BULK GAN SUBSTRATES PROVIDES LOW DARK/LEAKAGE CURRENT BY MINIMIZING DEFECTS FROM THE SUBSTRATE, WHILE ALTERNATELY ALN SUBSTRATES CAN BE USED TO PROVIDE BACKSIDE-ILLUMINATED, HIGH FILL FACTOR UV-APD DEVICES. IN ADDITION TO LOW DARK CURRENT NOISE, THE SOLID-STATE UV-APD DEVICES DEMONSTRATE HIGH QUANTUM EFFICIENCIES WITH VERY HIGH AVALANCHE GAINS (>10^5). FOR THE PHASE II SBIR EFFORT, WE SHALL MODEL, DESIGN, DEVELOP, AND DEMONSTRATE THE ALGAN UV-APD ARRAY TECHNOLOGY FOR IMPLEMENTATION IN FUTURE NASA MISSIONS. WE WILL WORK WITH NASA FOR MODELLING UV-APD ARRAYS FOR PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS IN NASA EARTH SCIENCE SYSTEMS. MAGNOLIA WILL COLLABORATE WITH PROF. RUSS DUPUIS OF GEORGIA TECH, AN EXPERT IN III-N MATERIAL GROWTH AND DEVICE TECHNOLOGY, FOR MOCVD GROWTH, FABRICATION, AND CHARACTERIZATION OF THE UV-APD ARRAY DEVICES. THIS WILL ENTAIL THE ENHANCEMENT OF SURFACE PASSIVATION TECHNIQUES FOR FURTHER PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS, DEVELOPING HIGH QUALITY, LOW RESISTIVITY N- AND P-TYPE CONTACTS, AS WELL AS INCORPORATING ANTIREFLECTION COATINGS. IT IS EXPECTED BASED ON MEASUREMENT DATA THAT THESE DEVICES CAN PERFORM IN GEIGER-MODE AT #tilde#355 NM WITH HIGH SINGLE-PHOTON DETECTION EFFICIENCIES FOR OPERATION IN PHOTON-STARVED ENVIRONMENTS.

      "description": "IGF::OT::IGF  AS THE POWER DENSITY OF ADVANCED ENGINES INCREASES, THE NEED FOR NEW MATERIALS THAT ARE CAPABLE OF HIGHER OPERATING TEMPERATURES, SUCH AS CERAMIC MATRIX COMPOSITES (CMCS), IS CRITICAL FOR TURBINE HOT-SECTION STATIC AND ROTATING COMPONENTS. SUCH ADVANCED MATERIALS HAVE DEMONSTRATED THE PROMISE TO SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE ENGINE TEMPERATURE CAPABILITY RELATIVE TO CONVENTIONAL SUPER ALLOY METALLIC BLADES. THEY ALSO SHOW THE POTENTIAL TO ENABLE LONGER LIFE, REDUCED EMISSIONS, GROWTH MARGIN, REDUCED WEIGHT AND INCREASED PERFORMANCE RELATIVE TO SUPER ALLOY BLADE MATERIALS. MR&D IS PROPOSING TO PERFORM A COMBINED ANALYTICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL PROGRAM TO DEVELOP A DURABILITY MODEL FOR CMC ENVIRONMENTAL BARRIER COATINGS (EBC). EBCS ARE REQUIRED FOR CMCS IN TURBINE EXHAUST ENVIRONMENTS BECAUSE OF THE PRESENCE OF HIGH TEMPERATURE WATER. THE EBC PROTECTS THE CMC AND SIGNIFICANTLY SLOWS RECESSION. HOWEVER, THE DURABILITY OF THESE MATERIALS IS NOT WELL UNDERSTOOD MAKING LIFE PREDICTION VERY CHALLENGING. THIS PROGRAM SEEKS TO ENHANCE THE DURABILITY MODEL DEVELOPED IN PHASE I TO ACCURATELY EVALUATE THE LIFE OF THE EBC FOR A CMC TURBINE BLADE HELPING TO FACILITATE THEIR INCLUSION IN FUTURE ENGINE DESIGNS. THIS GOAL WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED BY GROUNDING THE MODEL WITH EXPERIMENTAL TESTS, WHICH WILL PROVIDE BOTH FUNDAMENTAL PROPERTIES OF THE EBC SYSTEM AND A REALISTIC SIMULATION OF THE ENGINE ENVIRONMENT. THE ENGINE SIMULATION TESTS WILL PROVIDE A WAY FOR MR&D TO VALIDATE THE MODEL."

WE ALSO PROPOSE AN EXTENSION TO THE MANNER IN WHICH CONDITIONS WERE DEVELOPED IN PHASE I. CONDITIONS WERE DEVELOPED USING POST ANALYSIS OF ACCIDENTS AND INCIDENTS. THE ERROR CHAIN OF EVENTS WAS IDENTIFIED, INFORMATION NECESSARY TO PREVENT THE EVENT WAS IDENTIFIED, AND FINALLY, A CONDITION DEVELOPED THAT DETECTED THE CIRCUMSTANCES FOR A POSSIBLE SAFETY FAILURE SO THAT A NOTIFICATION COULD BE TRANSMITTED TO THE ACTOR WHO WOULD THEN TAKE THE APPROPRIATE ACTION TO BREAK THE ERROR CHAIN. THIS PARADIGM OF CONDITION DEVELOPMENT CAN BE CHARACTERIZED AS REACTIVE. WITH THE NAS MOVING INTO A STATE OF FLUX WITH THE INTEGRATION OF UAVS AND GENERAL INCREASED TRAFFIC VOLUME, REACTIVE SAFETY MAY NOT BE ACCEPTABLE. IN ORDER TO CONTINUE THE STEADILY IMPROVING SAFETY RECORD OF AVIATION, A MORE PROACTIVE APPROACH MUST BE CONSIDERED.

THE PROPOSED DM MANUFACTURING AND ASIC INTEGRATION AIMS TO DEVELOP DMS TO MEET THE TWO STAGED NEEDS THROUGH ONE JOINT DM-ASIC DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM."

THIS ENGINE WILL BE THE ONLY PROPULSION ON THE EUROPA CLIPPER SPACECRAFT.  THE DUAL SPLIT TRIPLET-13 (DST-13) ENGINE HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BY JPL AND JH/APL AS THE ONLY ENGINE THAT CAN MEET THE EUROPA MISSION REQUIREMENT.  THE DST-13 ENGINE CONSISTS OF TWO MAIN PARTS:  (1) A VALVE WHICH CONTROLS THE PROPELLANT FLOW TO THE ENGINE AND (2) THE ENGINE ASSEMBLY WHICH CONTAINS THE PROPELLANT INJECTOR, COMBUSTION CHAMBER AND EXPANSION NOZZLE.  THE FOLLOWING THREE REQUIREMENTS HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED TO CONDUCT A RISK REDUCTION PROGRAM TO DEVELOP A MODIFIED VERSION OF THE DST-13 ENGINE FOR THE EUROPA SPACECRAFT:   (1) DEVELOP A MODIFIED VERSION OF THE MOOG 51-78 SINGLE SEAT SOLENOID VALVE AND FABRICATE THREE SOLENOID VALVES.  THIS REQUIREMENT IS TO CHANGE THE VALVE FROM A DUAL SEAT CONFIGURATION TO A SINGLE SEAT CONFIGURATION IN ADDITION TO CHANGING THE VALVE SEAT MATERIAL FROM TEFLON POLYTETRAFLUOROETHYLENE (PTFE) TO TEFLON PERFLUOROALKOXY (PFA).  THIS MATERIAL CHANGE IS NECESSARY BECAUSE THE PTFE WILL NOT SURVIVE IN THE SEVERE RADIATION ENVIRONMENT THAT THE EUROPA SPACECRAFT WILL ENCOUNTER DURING THE JUPITER ORBIT.  (2) DEVELOP A THRUST CHAMBER WITH A PARTIALLY COATED NOZZLE.  THE CURRENT NOZZLE ON THE DST-13 ENGINE IS FULLY COATED WITH HAFNIUM OXIDE (HFO).  THIS REQUIREMENT IS TO PARTIALLY COAT THE ENGINE EXPANSION NOZZLE WITH A (HFO) COATING.  A PARTIALLY COATED VERSION IS NECESSARY IN ORDER TO REDUCE THE HEAT LOSS FROM THE SPACECRAFT DURING THE LONG CRUISE PHASE OF THE MISSION.    (3) CONDUCT TESTS ON VALVE AND NOZZLE.  GSFC WILL SUPPLY A DST-13 ENGINE THAT WAS USED DURING THE EUROPA ENGINE DEVELOPMENT TESTS AT MOOG IN SEPTEMBER, 2016.  THE ENGINE IS THE PROTOTYPE FOR THE EUROPA FLIGHT ENGINE.  ONCE THE MODIFICATIONS DESCRIBED ABOVE ARE COMPLETE, THE ENGINE WILL BE SUBJECTED TO SHOCK, VIBRATION AND HOT FIRE TESTING TO VALIDATE IT HAS THE CAPABILITY TO MEET THE EUROPA MISSION REQUIREMENTS."

THIS METHOD INVOLVES THE PREPARATION OF PROPRIETARY FAST CURABLE INKS AS WELL AS FILAMENTS FOR THE CRITICAL MATERIALS NECESSARY; THE CARTRIDGE DEPOSITION TECHNOLOGIES, AND THE SOFTWARE LAYOUT AND CONTROL TO PRODUCE A MULTITUDE OF ELECTRONIC DEVICES. THE PRIMARY GOAL OF THE PHASE I EFFORT WAS TO DETERMINE THE VIABILITY OF THE ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING TECHNIQUE FROM A MATERIALS STANDPOINT. MORNINGBIRD MEDIA CORPORATION HAS DEVELOPED NEW TECHNIQUES TO CREATE THE INK-BASED AND/OR FILAMENT BASED MATERIALS FOR CONDUCTIVE, RESISTIVE, CAPACITIVE, SEMICONDUCTING AND INSULATING MATERIALS. SEVERAL METHODOLOGIES WERE EXPLORED: (A) DIRECT LASER MELTING OF NANOPOWDERS ONTO THE SURFACE, (B) AN INK-BASED APPROACH USING NANOPOWDER MIXTURES WITH FAST UV CURABLE EPOXY, (C) NANOPOWDER/ABS MATERIAL MIXTURES IN AN ACETONE SOLUTION, AND (D) FILAMENTS CREATED FROM A NANOPOWDER AND A THERMOPLASTIC ADHESIVE. THE COMPANY HAS ALSO DESIGNED A UNIQUE PRINT CARTRIDGE AND A LAYOUT AND CONTROL SOFTWARE PACKAGE. WE DETERMINED THE MOST VIABLE MATERIAL DEVELOPMENT PROCESS AND APPLIED IT TO A PROTOTYPE PRINTER TO PRODUCE AND TEST THE FIRST ELECTRONIC ELEMENTS. THIS PRINTING TECHNIQUE COMPLETELY ELIMINATES THE NEEDS OF POST-PROCESSING. THIS WORK HAS THE CAPABILITY OF REVOLUTIONIZING THE WAY ELECTRONICS ARE DESIGNED, PRODUCED, AND IMPLEMENTED IN ALL OF TECHNOLOGY. A COMMERCIAL PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY IS FORMULATED AROUND THE ELECTRONIC ALCHEMY (TM) SYSTEM AS A CONSUMER PRODUCT IN ORDER TO PRINT UNIQUE 3D STRUCTURES WITH ELECTRICAL/ELECTRONIC FUNCTIONALITY."

      "description": "THE PROPOSAL FOR THE PHASE II EXTENSION IS TO ADDRESS A SIGNIFICANT ISSUE THAT AROSE DURING THE PHASE II WORK. SIC/SIC CMC MATERIALS HAVE STRENGTH VERSUS TEMPERATURE CHARACTERISTICS DIFFERENT FROM CONVENTIONAL METALLIC HPT TURBINE BLADE MATERIALS. IT IS NOT FEASIBLE TO COOL SIC/SIC CMC BLADES IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE STRENGTHS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THEIR STRENGTH AT THEIR UPPER USE TEMPERATURE. SIC/SIC CMC BLADES HAVE HIGHER TEMPERATURE CAPABILITY THAN CONVENTIONAL METALLIC BLADES, AND BOTH MATERIALS HAVE NEARLY EQUAL STRENGTHS AT THEIR RESPECTIVE UPPER USE TEMPERATURES. AT TEMPERATURES BELOW THEIR UPPER USE TEMPERATURES THE STRENGTH INCREASE AS TEMPERATURE DECREASES IS MUCH LESS FOR SIC/SIC CMC MATERIALS THAN FOR CONVENTIONAL METALLIC BLADE MATERIALS. THE CONSEQUENCE OF THESE DIFFERENT STRENGTH VERSUS TEMPERATURE RELATIONSHIPS IS THAT THE STRENGTH OF A SECOND STAGE SIC/SIC BLADE DETERMINES THE HIGH PRESSURE SHAFT RPM. REDUCING THE HIGH PRESSURE SHAFT RPM INCREASES ENGINE WEIGHT. THE PROPOSED WORK IS TO EXAMINE TWO APPROACHES TO REDUCE HPT BLADE STRESSES, WITHOUT INCURRING A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN STAGE EFFICIENCY. THE FIRST APPROACH IS TO INCREASE BLADE THROUGH FLOW VELOCITY, WHICH REDUCES THE ANNULUS FLOW AREA. REDUCING THE ANNULUS FLOW AREA REDUCES CENTRIFUGAL STRESSES. THE SECOND APPROACH IS TO ANALYZE HIGHLY TAPERED ROTOR BLADES. TAPERING BLADES TO REDUCE THE TIP-TO-HUB AXIAL CHORD RATIO ALSO REDUCES CENTRIFUGAL STRESSES. BOTH STRUCTURAL AND CFD BLADE ROW EFFICIENCY ANALYSES ARE NEEDED. THE TWO APPROACHES ARE NOT EXCLUSIVE, AND MAY BE COMBINED TO ACHIEVE AN OPTIMUM SIC/SIC BLADE CONFIGURATION. WHILE THE FOCUS OF THE WORK IS THE SECOND STAGE BLADE, THE RESULTS ARE APPLICABLE TO THE FIRST STAGE BLADE. WHEN STATOR AND ROTOR BLADES OF BOTH HPT STAGES ARE SIC/SIC BLADES THE MAXIMUM FUEL BURN BENEFIT FROM USING CMC IS ACHIEVED. THE PROPOSED WORK SEEKS TO REDUCE OR ELIMINATE THE CONSTRAINTS IMPOSED ON THE HIGH PRESSURE COMPONENTS BY THE SECOND STAGE BLADE. THE CONSTRAINTS ARE DUE TO THE STRENGTH VERSUS TEMPERATURE CHARACTERISTICS OF SIC/SIC MATERIALS. THE PROPOSED WORK FURTHERS NASA S GOAL OF REDUCED FUEL BURN FOR AIRCRAFT ENGINES. THE NOMINAL N+3 SINGLE AISLE AIRCRAFT ENGINE HAS A TWO STAGE HPT WITH AN OVERALL PRESSURE RATIO OF FOUR. A TOTAL-TO-TOTAL PRESSURE RATIO OF TWO PER STAGE ALLOWS A RELATIVELY HIGH AXIAL MACH NUMBER BEFORE SONIC CONDITIONS ARE REACHED IN EITHER THE STATOR OR ROTOR. PRELIMINARY ANALYSES SHOW THAT SIGNIFICANT STRESS REDUCTIONS CAN BE ACHIEVED FOR EITHER APPROACH WITHOUT A LARGE STAGE AERODYNAMIC EFFICIENCY PENALTY. THE PHASE II WORK SHOWED THAT A 20% REDUCTION IN HP SHAFT SPEED FROM THE N+3 NOTIONAL SHAFT SPEED WAS REQUIRED TO ACHIEVE ACCEPTABLE SIC/SIC CMC BLADE STRESSES. PRELIMINARY ANALYSES INDICATE THAT ACCEPTABLE BLADE STRESSES CAN BE ACHIEVED AT THE N+3 NOTIONAL HP SHAFT SPEED WITH HIGHER THROUGH FLOW AND TAPERED ROTOR BLADES. IN SUMMARY THE PROPOSED WORK IS TO PERFORM STRUCTURAL AND CFD ANALYSES FOR FOUR TURBINE BLADE CON- FIGURATIONS. THESE ARE TWO HIGH THROUGH FLOW CONFIGURATIONS, A TAPERED BLADE CONFIGURATION, AND A COMBINED HIGH THROUGH FLOW PLUS TAPERED BLADE CONFIGURATION. THE REFERENCE CASES FOR THESE ANALYSES HAVE BEEN AN- ALYZED AS PART OF THE PHASE II WORK. FOR THE HIGH THROUGH FLOW CASES STRUCTURAL AND CFD ANALYSES WILL BE DONE FOR BOTH SHROUDED AND UNSHROUDED BLADES. THE EFFICIENCY GAIN DUE TO SHROUDING INCREASES AS THE THROUGH FLOW VELOCITY INCREASES. INCREASING THROUGH FLOW VELOCITY DECREASES ANNULUS HEIGHT AND INCREASES THE CLEARANCE-TO-SPAN RATIO. A HIGHLY TAPERED BLADE IS NOT EXPECTED TO PROVIDE SUFFICIENT STRUCTURAL SUPPORT FOR A SHROUD. FOR EACH CASE THE RESULTS WILL SHOW THE BENEFIT IN TERMS OF REDUCED STRESSES AND THE CHANGE IN STAGE EFFICIENCY."

THE FIRST IS TO IDENTIFY STAGE EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENTS AND VERIFY STRUCTURAL FEASIBILITY OF SHROUDING A LOW ASPECT RATIO HPT ROTOR BLADE DESIGNED TO USE CMC BLADES. THE SECOND IS TO PERFORM SIMILAR ANALYSES FOR METALLIC AND CMC LPT BLADES . HPT STAGE EFFICIENCY GAINS WILL BE DETERMINED USING CFD ANALYSES FOR SHROUDED AND UNSHROUDED HPT TURBINES AS A FUNCTION OF CLEARANCE AND STAGE REACTION. THE INCREASE IN BLADE COMPONENT STRESSES DUE TO THE PRESENCE OF A SHROUD, AND THE STRESSES IN THE SHROUD ITSELF WILL BE DETERMINED FROM STRUCTURAL ANALYSES. COMPARING ANALYTIC RESULTS WITH AVAILABLE STRUCTURAL DATA FOR SHROUDED METALLIC LPT BLADES WILL INCREASE CONFIDENCE IN THE STRUCTURAL PREDICTIONS OF SHROUDED HPT BLADES. THE REDUCTION IN ENGINE WEIGHT FROM USING CMC BLADES IN THE LPT WILL BE DETERMINED. CURRENT METALLIC LPT BLADES ARE SHROUDED, SO THAT NO SIGNIFICANT STAGE AERODYNAMIC EFFICIENCY GAIN IS ANTICIPATED FROM REPLACING METALLIC LPT BLADES WITH CMC BLADES. IN A GEARED TURBINE FEWER LPT STAGES, OR GREATER WORK PER STAGE, MAY BE ACHIEVED FROM USING CMC ROTOR BLADES."

      "description": "IGF::OT::IGFTHE PROPOSED PROGRAM ADDRESSES NASA''S NEED FOR A NEW GENERATION OF ICING MITIGATION TECHNOLOGY FOR MANNED AND UNMANNED VEHICLES. THE STATE OF THE ART ACTIVE DE-ICING METHOD ON LEADING EDGES INVOLVES EITHER AN ELECTRICAL, PNEUMATIC OR VIBRATION INDUCED DEBONDING OF ACCUMULATED ICE. THERE IS A NEED FOR AN ANTI-ICE COATING THAT FUNCTIONS SYNERGISTICALLY WITH ACTIVE DE-ICING METHODS. THE ADVANTAGES ARE REDUCED POWER CONSUMPTION, IMPROVED SERVICE LIFE OF MECHANICAL COMPONENTS, LIGHTER ELECTRONICS AND EXTRA PROTECTION IN CASE OF FAILURE OF ACTIVE DEVICE. THE PHASE I PROGRAM HAS ADDRESSED THIS NEED AND TECHNOLOGY GAP, AND HAS DEMONSTRATED THE FEASIBILITY OF COMBINING A DURABLE ANTI-ICE COATING WITH AN ACTIVE DEICING DEVICE, THEREBY CREATING AN INTEGRATED DE-ICING SYSTEM. ICING TUNNEL TESTING RESULTS DEMONSTRATED THAT THE COATING PROVIDES IMPROVED DE-ICING EFFICIENCY, ALONG WITH A REDUCTION IN POWER CONSUMPTION OF THE ACTIVE DE-ICING DEVICE. IN COLLABORATION WITH A MANUFACTURER OF ACTIVE DE-ICING SYSTEMS AND A COMPANY DEVELOPING ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES TO ENHANCE AIRCRAFT PERFORMANCE AND SAFETY, THE PHASE II EFFORT WILL REFINE THE COATING COMPOSITION AND APPLICATION CHARACTERISTICS FOR USE ON AIRCRAFT SO AS TO MEET THE STRINGENT REQUIREMENTS OF THE AEROSPACE AND AERONAUTIC INDUSTRY. FURTHER, WE WILL ESTABLISH A PRODUCT SPECIFICATION OF AN ANTI-ICE COATING SYSTEM FOR USE WITH ACTIVE DE-ICING SYSTEMS AND DEVELOP PROTOCOLS FOR APPLYING THE COATING AT BOTH OEM SITES AND FIELD APPLICATIONS. THE SUCCESS OF THE PROGRAM WILL LEAD TO PREVENTION OF ICE BUILDUP ON AIRCRAFT LEADING EDGES, IMPROVE AIRCRAFT SAFETY, AND REDUCE ENERGY CONSUMPTION DURING DEICING PROCEDURES."

THE ABILITY TO AUTONOMOUSLY ISOLATE SPACECRAFT FAILURES TO COMPONENT LEVELS WILL ENABLE FASTER RECOVERY THEREBY REDUCING DOWN TIME. MODEL-BASED SYSTEMS CAN PROVIDE BETTER FAULT COVERAGE THAN TRADITIONAL LIMIT-CHECKING SYSTEMS. THE PROPOSED SYSTEM IN PARTICULAR WILL RESULT IN A RELATIVELY COMPACT SOFTWARE PACKAGE BECAUSE IT RELIES ONLY ON MODELING NOMINAL BEHAVIOR; FAULT MODELS ARE NOT NEEDED. THUS THIS APPROACH HAS THE CAPABILITY TO DETECT ANY OFF-NOMINAL BEHAVIOR INCLUDING UN-MODELED FAULTS. HEALTH INFORMATION PRODUCED BY THE FM SYSTEM CAN BE USED TO MAKE RESOURCE ALLOCATION AND PLANNING AND SCHEDULING DECISIONS BY GROUND OPERATIONS OR BY OTHER ON-BOARD AUTONOMY AGENTS. THE SYSTEM CAN BE BUILT AND TESTED STANDALONE POTENTIALLY REDUCING FM DEVELOPMENTAL AND TESTING COSTS. THE FM SYSTEM PROVIDES AN EVOLUTIONARY APPROACH TO FULL ONBOARD AUTONOMY AS IT CAN FIRST BE IMPLEMENTED AND TESTED IN GROUND-BASED SYSTEMS AND THEN MIGRATED ONBOARD SPACECRAFT.

THIS NEXTSTEP CONTRACT BUILDS UPON THE SUCCESS OF COMMERCIAL ORBITAL TRANSPORTATION SERVICES SPACE ACT AGREEMENT DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM AND AN EXISTING INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION (ISS) COMMERCIAL RESUPPLY SERVICES (CRS) CONTRACT. ORBITAL HAS SUCCESSFULLY TRANSITIONED FROM COTS TO THE CRS PROGRAM, FLYING THREE VERY SUCCESSFUL PRESSURIZED CARGO RESUPPLY MISSIONS TO THE ISS, USING THE CYGNUS SPACECRAFT. ORBITAL ALSO SUCCESSFULLY DEVELOPED SPACECRAFT FOR SOLAR SYSTEM EXPLORATION TO INCLUDE THE CURRENTLY OPERATIONAL DAWN MISSION. THIS MISSION WAS LAUNCHED IN SEPTEMBER 2007, COMPLETED ITS RENDEZVOUS MISSION AT VESTA IN JULY 2012 AND IS EN ROUTE TO CERES IN EARLY 2015.  WITH SPACE AGENCY BUDGETS CONTINUING TO BE TIGHT, EXPLORATION PLANS NEED TO EMPHASIZE EVOLUTION OF EXISTING SYSTEMS, WHERE COST AND SCHEDULE IS BETTER CONTROLLED, AND DEVELOPMENT RISK REDUCED. SPECIFICALLY, ELEMENTS OF THE CURRENT ISS, INCLUDING CYGNUS, CAN BE EVOLVED TO SUPPORT MORE DISTANT SPACE DESTINATIONS. TO SUPPORT THESE ENDEAVORS, ORBITAL CONTRIBUTES TO THE DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCT IMPROVEMENT OF CYGNUS AND TO NEXTSTEP ACTIVITIES AND HAVE INVESTED IN THE COTS CRS PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP ENDEAVOR.  ORBITAL''S EXPLORATION AUGMENTATION MODULE (BAM) ARCHITECTURE USES A MODULAR, BUILDING BLOCK APPROACH THAT LEVERAGES THE CYGNUS SPACECRAFT TO EXPAND CISLUNAR AND LONG DURATION DEEP SPACE TRANSIT HABITATION CAPABILITIES AND TECHNOLOGIES CRITICAL TO NASAS LONG-TERM EXPLORATION GOALS.  ORBITALS ARCHITECTURE CONCEPT BLENDS IN-PRODUCTION HARDWARE WITH ADAPTATION, EVOLUTION, PLANNING, AND FORWARD THINKING. CYGNUS WILL SERVE AS A MODULAR HABITAT AND TEST PLATFORM FOR QUALIFYING TECHNOLOGIES IN A DISTANT RETROGRADE ORBIT (DRO) OR IN A LOW EARTH ORBIT (LEO), EITHER WHILE ATTACHED TO THE ISS OR AS A FREE-FLYER. USING THE EXISTING, OPERATIONAL CYGNUS TO PERFORM THESE MISSIONS HAS THE ADVANTAGE OF DECREASING OVERALL DEVELOPMENT TIME AND COSTS, AND FREEING UP RESOURCES THAT WOULD BE SPENT ON DEVELOPING A SPACECRAFT TO FOCUS ON CULTIVATING MISSION ENABLING TECHNOLOGIES.  THE GOAL IS TO HAVE A CYGNUS DERIVED EAM DEPLOYED IN CISLUNAR SPACE BEFORE 2020. THIS SPACECRAFT WILL BE THE FIRST BUILDING BLOCK IN SUPPORTING BOTH COMMERCIAL MARKETS AND GOVERNMENT OBJECTIVES. THE PROPOSED EFFORT FOR THIS NEXTSTEP BAA PHASE I, INVOLVES DEFINING AN EAM ARCHITECTURE AND CONCEPT OF OPERATIONS (CONOPS) THAT ADDRESSES COMMERCIAL MARKETS AND NASA EXPLORATION OBJECTIVES, TECHNOLOGY MATURATION PLANNING AND INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT, AND TO IDENTIFY TECHNOLOGIES THAT CAN BE IMPLEMENTED AND DEMONSTRATED IN THE ISSILEO ENVIRONMENT WITHIN THE NEXT THREE YEARS.  TO MATURE HABITATION TECHNOLOGIES, THE CONTRACTOR WILL IDENTIFY STATE OF THE ART (SOA) TECHNOLOGIES ACROSS NASA TECHNOLOGY AREAS (TAS) DEFINED IN THE NASA TECHNOLOGY ROADMAP.  FOCUS WILL BE ON MATURATION OF THE FOLLOWING TECHNOLOGIES   ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROL AND LIFE SUPPORT SYSTEMS   ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING   SAFETY AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE AND HABITATION   THERMAL CONTROL SYSTEMS   AUTONOMOUS HABITATION SYSTEMS   NAVIGATION   SYSTEMS MANAGEMENT   DOCKING AND CAPTURE   MECHANISMS AND DEPLOYABLE HABITATION ELEMENTS"

IT IS THE COUPLING OF THESE WELL DEVELOPED AND UNDERSTOOD PROCESSES THAT IS NOVEL AND OFFERS A SIGNIFICANT ADVANTAGE OVER STATE OF THE ART (SOA) SPACECRAFT WATER PROCESSING SYSTEMS. THE INTEGRATED WATER RECOVERY ASSEMBLY (IRA) WILL REDUCE CONSUMABLE CONSUMPTION BY REMOVING THE NEED FOR HAZARDOUS CHEMICAL PRETREAT AND MAY ELIMINATE THE NEED FOR AQUEOUSPHASE TREATMENT NOW USED TO REACH POTABLE STANDARDS. IT WILL ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE WASTE GENERATION AND INCREASE MATERIAL RECYCLING BY CONVERTING CARBON, HYDROGEN, AND NITROGEN SPECIES INTO USEFUL PRODUCTS SUCH ASH2O, N2, AND CO2. IRA WILL BE LESS COMPLEX, REQUIRE FEWER CONSUMABLES, BE MORE ROBUST, AND MORE SUSTAINABLE THAN SOA SYSTEMS. IRA SHOULD PRODUCE A CONCENTRATED AND DRIED SOLID WASTE STREAM THAT IS ALWAYS CONTAINED AND CONSISTS OF SALTS AND RESIDUAL ORGANIC MATTER. MABR AND NWP HAVE DEVELOPED AS INDEPENDENT SUBSYSTEMS FOR HUMAN SPACEFLIGHT WASTEWATER PROCESSING BUT THEIR UNIQUE ATTRIBUTES HAVE NOT BEEN OPTIMIZED TO FUNCTION TOGETHER AS AN INTEGRATED WASTEWATER RECYCLING SYSTEM. NEITHER IS INDIVIDUALLY CAPABLE OF PRODUCING POTABLE WATER, BUT COMBINED WITH MATURE GTCR TECHNOLOGY, WE PROPOSE THAT IRA REPRESENTS A SIGNIFICANT ADVANCEMENT OVER SOA OF THE ART SPACECRAFT WASTEWATER PROCESSING SYSTEMS. IN SUMMARY, THE INNOVATION WE PROPOSE IS TO COMBINE AND OPTIMIZE ALL THREE STAGES INTO A NOVEL INTEGRATED SYSTEM CAPABLE OF PROCESSING HABITATION WASTEWATER AND PRODUCING CLEAN WATER FOR ALL HABITAT NEEDS."

THE INITIAL 1 KWE FPS REQUIRES A TOTAL RADIATING SURFACE OF 2.5 M2. HIGHER POWER DESIGNS WILL REQUIRE CORRESPONDING LARGER RADIATING SURFACES. IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE OPTIMUM RADIATOR PERFORMANCE, THE FACE SHEETS OF THESE RADIATORS SHOULD PRESENT WASTE HEAT LOADS AS ISOTHERMAL SHEETS POINTED TO THE SINK OF SPACE.

UNDER PHASE I, PEREGRINE HAS SUCCESSFULLY DEMONSTRATED AN ALTERNATIVE DESIGN WHICH PROMISES TO BE LOWER IN MASS WHILE IMPROVING PERFORMANCE BASED UPON PULSATING HEAT PIPES (PHPS). PHPS CAN DIRECTLY ACQUIRE AND THEN READILY DISTRIBUTE THERMAL LOADS ACROSS THE FACE OF RADIATOR PANELS TO CREATE HIGHLY EFFICIENT NEAR ISOTHERMAL DESIGNS. PHPS ARE AN AUTONOMOUS, SELF-CONTAINED, LOW PROFILE, LIGHTWEIGHT, HIGH PERFORMANCE THERMAL TRANSPORT SYSTEM BASED UPON HEAT OF VAPORIZATION.

USING FCP IS AS SIMPLE AS SPRAYING OR BRUSHING IT ON A SURFACE OF INTEREST, ALLOWING IT TO DRY FOR 15 MINUTES, AND STRIPPING OFF THE RUGGED COATING WHEN DESIRED. MULTIPLE MEASUREMENTS, INCLUDING AT NASA S GODDARD SPACE FLIGHT CENTER, SHOW THAT FCP CLEANS BETTER THAN ANY EXISTING METHOD, INCLUDING THE COMPLICATED, EXPENSIVE, AND HAZARDOUS CO2 SNOW, LEAVING NO DETECTIBLE RESIDUE. FCP IS USED TO CLEAN TELESCOPE OPTICS AT THE KECK OBSERVATORY, GTC IN THE CANARY ISLANDS, VANDENBERG AIRFORCE BASE, ETC. THE POLYMER WAS USED BY LIGO TO CLEAN THE OPTICS THAT ENABLED ITS BREAKTHROUGH DISCOVERY OF GRAVITATIONAL WAVES, AND ENABLES THE THAAD MISSILE INTERCEPTOR BY PROTECTING AND CLEANING ITS OPTICS. FCP WAS EVEN USED AT THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTE TO CLEAN IRREPLACEABLE GEMS SUCH AS THE HOPE DIAMOND, DEMONSTRATING POTENTIAL USES FAR BEYOND OPTICS. OUR TECHNOLOGY IS A CROSSCUTTING SOLUTION ENABLING THE DEMANDING CLEANLINESS REQUIREMENTS OF THE EXO-S STARSHADE PROBE S OCCULTER, REDUCING THE DURATION AND COST OF MEETING PLANETARY PROTECTION REQUIREMENTS WITHOUT DAMAGING SENSITIVE COMPONENTS, AND PROVIDING CLEANROOM-LEVEL CLEANLINESS WITHOUT THE CLEANROOM, INCLUDING FOR SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING. SINCE OUR RED FCP EXHIBITS ANOMALOUSLY HIGH ADHESION TO CERTAIN METALS AND THE AMORPHOUS METALLIC GLASS OF STARSHADE PETAL EDGES, WE DEVELOPED IN PHASE I A VARIANT WITH LOWER ADHESION TO METALS. WHILE THE RESULTING ADHESION WAS TOO LOW TO BE OPTIMAL, IT DEMONSTRATED THE ADHESION TUNABILITY OF OUR PRODUCT. IN PHASE II, WE PRODUCE 18 VARIANTS, IDENTIFYING THE LOWEST-COST ONE THAT PROVIDES OPTIMAL ADHESION TO PROTECT, CLEAN, AND MINIMIZE THE CONTRIBUTION OF PEELING TO A MISSION S ALIGNMENT ERROR BUDGET. WE ALSO DEVELOP STANDARD OPERATION PROCEDURES AND TRAINING FOR APPLICATION AND REMOVAL."

THE TECHNOLOGY EMPLOYS A PROPULSION SCHEME COMPRISING A STORABLE LIQUID OXIDIZER AND A UNIQUE SOLID FUEL WITH EXCELLENT MECHANICAL AND THERMOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES. THE PROPOSED APPLICATION TO LAUNCH VEHICLE STAGES WILL RESULT IN LOW-COST, MASS-EFFICIENT LAUNCH SYSTEMS AND WILL REDUCE TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENT RISK FOR NASA. THE FUEL AND OXIDIZER ARE COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE AT LOW COST AS AN INEXPENSIVE ENGINEERING MATERIAL AND AS AN INDUSTRIAL CHEMICAL. BOTH HAVE HIGH DENSITY, ARE GREEN, AND THE SYSTEM HAS A HIGH SPECIFIC IMPULSE (>275S; VACUUM). THE OXIDIZER STORAGE, HANDLING, TRANSPORTATION, AND LOADING OPERATIONS ARE SIMPLER AND SAFER COMPARED TO CRYOGENIC/TOXIC PROPELLANTS. THE FOREGOING ATTRIBUTES ENABLE THE LOWER COST OF THE PROPOSED HYBRID LAUNCH VEHICLE STAGE. THE PERFORMANCE OFCURRENT HYBRIDS IS LIMITED BY THEIR TYPICALLY LOW FUEL REGRESSION RATES. IN PHASE I, WE INVESTIGATED TECHNIQUES FOR SIGNIFICANTLY AUGMENTING THE REGRESSION RATE, DEMONSTRATING #tilde# 3.5X INCREASE IN 30 LBF THRUSTER FIRINGS. USING THIS DATA, WE PERFORMED DESIGN TRADES FOR A HYBRID STAGE AS THE SECOND/UPPER LAUNCH VEHICLE STAGE. THE ENHANCED REGRESSION RATE ALLOWED A MORE COMPACT, LIGHTER, HIGHER THRUST-TO-WEIGHT STAGE THAN WOULD BE POSSIBLE WITH CURRENT HYBRIDS. IN PHASE II, WE WILL PERFORM DETAILED EXPERIMENTS TO OPTIMIZE PROPULSIVE PERFORMANCE ON THE SAME PHASE I HYBRID THRUSTER, AND DEMONSTRATE A LARGE SCALE (#tilde#1000 LBF) MOTOR, REPRESENTATIVE OF UPPER STAGES OF A LAUNCH VEHICLE INCORPORATING THE OPTIMIZED DESIGN. PHASE II WILL END WITH A FLIGHT PROTOTYPE DESIGN AND A PLAN FOR A SUB-ORBITAL FLIGHT TEST, OR A COMPREHENSIVE GROUND TEST IN SIMULATED ENVIRONMENT."

      "description": "THE LIQUID SORPTION PUMP (LSP) IS A NEW TECHNOLOGY FOR ACQUIRING CO2 FROM THE MARTIAN ATMOSPHERE FOR USE IN IN SITU RESOURCE UTILIZATION (ISRU) SYSTEMS. IN THE LSP, A SOLVENT, SUCH AS AN ALCOHOL, KETONE, OR ACETATE IS COOLED TO TEMPERATURES BELOW -100 C, WHERE IT BECOMES AN EFFECTIVE SOLVENT FOR MARS ATMOSPHERIC CO2. AFTER ABSORBING 5 PERCENT OR MORE BY MOLE CO2, THE SOLVENT IS PUMPED TO ANOTHER VESSEL WHERE IT IS HEATED TO 30 C, RELEASING THE CO2 AT PRESSURES OF MORE THAN 1 BAR. THE CLEAN WARM SOLVENT IS THEN SENT BACK TO THE ABSORPTION VESSEL, EXCHANGING HEAT WITH THE COLD ABSORPTION COLUMN EFFLUENT AS IT GOES. AFTER THE CLEAN SOLVENT IS COOLED TO NEAR THE DESIGN ABSORPTION TEMPERATURE IN THIS WAY, A MECHANICAL REFRIGERATOR IS USED TO ACHIEVE THE FINAL TEMPERATURE REDUCTION. ADVANTAGES OF THE LSP ARE THAT IT CAN OPERATE CONTINUOUSLY DAY OR NIGHT WITHOUT THE NEED FOR MECHANICAL VACUUM ROUGHING PUMPS, SOLID FREEZERS, OR LARGE SORPTION BEDS, REQUIRES LESS POWER THAN OTHER OPTIONS, IS READILY SCALABLE TO HIGH OUTPUTS, AND THAT IT STOPS ALL SULFUR, DUST, OR NON-CONDENSABLE GASES FROM REACHING THE ISRU REACTOR SYSTEM. IN THE PROPOSED SBIR PHASE 2, AN OPERATING PROTOFLIGHT LSP UNIT MEETING THE FULL-SCALE NASA CO2 ACQUISITION REQUIREMENT NEEDED TO SUPPORT WILL BE DEMONSTRATED AND ITS PERFORMANCE ASSESSED."

THE AOWG INTEGRATES STEAM REFORMATION, METHANATION, AND ELECTROLYSIS TO CONVERT ORGANIC WASTE INTO WATER, DRY VENT GAS, AND A SMALL AMOUNT OF INORGANIC RESIDUE, THEREBY REDUCING TRANSIT PROPELLANT AND TANKAGE MASS. THE AOWG REDUCES RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH STORING, HANDLING, AND DISPOSING FOOD WASTE AND PACKAGING, WASTE PAPER, WIPES AND TOWELS, GLOVES, FECAL MATTER, URINE BRINE, AND MAXIMUM ABSORBENCY GARMENTS IN MICROGRAVITY ENVIRONMENTS. THE REFORMER PROVIDES NEARLY COMPLETE CONVERSION OF FEEDS TO VALUABLE WATER AND JETTISONED GAS WITH MINIMAL LOSSES AND CONSUMABLES REQUIREMENTS WHILE OPERATING AT PRESSURES JUST ABOVE THE AMBIENT ENVIRONMENT. THE BASELINE AOWG PHASE II DESIGN INCORPORATES SIGNIFICANT NOVEL ENHANCEMENTS TO PREVIOUS STATE-OF-THE-ART TRASH TO GAS (TTG) STEAM REFORMING TECHNOLOGY INCLUDING A FEED SHREDDER, FEED DRYER, CONTINUOUS FEEDER, TAR DESTRUCTION REACTOR, AND WATER PURIFICATION. THE LARGELY AUTOMATED AOWG LIMITS CREW OPERATION REQUIREMENTS PRIMARILY TO LOADING PACKAGED WASTES INTO THE FEED HOPPER AND OCCASIONAL DISCHARGE AND COMPACTION OF ASH RESIDUE. THE PROPOSED PHASE II AOWG WILL BE DEVELOPED WITH A FOCUS ON ACHIEVING COMPLETE ORGANIC WASTE GASIFICATION SIMULTANEOUS WITH MAXIMUM WATER PRODUCTION USING FEEDING, MATERIALS HANDLING, AND ANCILLARY SYSTEMS GEARED TO MICROGRAVITY OPERATIONS. THESE CONCEPTS WILL BE INTEGRATED INTO A PROTOFLIGHT PHASE II DESIGN, WHICH WILL CONSIDER AND ACCOMMODATE THE MICROGRAVITY ENVIRONMENT NECESSARY TO OPERATE THE AOWG THROUGH STARTUP, STEADY OPERATION, AND SHUTDOWN. THIS PROGRESSION OF DEVELOPMENT WILL LEAD TO IMPLEMENTATION IN ADVANCED HUMAN SPACE MISSIONS."

A CRITICAL ASPECT OF NTP IS TO DEVELOP A ROBUST, STABLE FUEL. ONE OF THE FUEL CONFIGURATIONS CURRENTLY BEING EVALUATED IS A W-UO2 CERMET. FABRICATION OF FULL-SIZE CERMET ELEMENTS (>20?) HAS PROVEN TO BE DIFFICULT. AS A RESULT, THE USE OF CERMET SEGMENTS TO PRODUCE A FULL-SIZE FUEL ELEMENT IS OF INTEREST. HOWEVER, TECHNIQUES FOR JOINING THE SEGMENTS ARE NEEDED. DURING PHASE I, DIFFUSION BONDING TECHNIQUES WERE DEVELOPED FOR PRODUCING FUEL ELEMENTS FROM CERMET SEGMENTS. MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION AND PRELIMINARY PROPERTIES TESTING SHOWED EXCELLENT JOINTS WERE FORMED. FOR EXAMPLE, QUANTITATIVE TENSILE TESTING OF W SAMPLES PRODUCED AT 1500C HIP WITH A NB INTERFACIAL COATING SHOWED THE FAILURES WERE IN THE BULK W AND NOT AT THE NB-W INTERFACES. THEREFORE, THE STRENGTH OF THE JOINTS WERE GREATER THAN THE STRENGTH OF THE BULK W MATERIAL. USING THE MOST PROMISING FABRICATION METHODS, A 6.3'' LONG SIMULATED CERMET FUEL ELEMENT COMPRISED OF TWENTY-FIVE 0.25'' THICK SEGMENTS WAS PRODUCED TO DEMONSTRATE PROOF-OF-CONCEPT. DURING THE PHASE II INVESTIGATION, THE HIP DIFFUSION BONDING PROCESS WILL BE OPTIMIZED FOR MAKING W CERMET BASED FUEL ELEMENTS. THIS WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED BY PERFORMING A PROCESS PARAMETER-CHARACTERIZATION-PROPERTIES STUDY. THE OPTIMIZED FABRICATION METHODS WILL THEN BE USED TO MAKE PROTOTYPE FUEL ELEMENTS WITH W CLADDINGS AND SUBSCALE FUEL ELEMENTS FOR DELIVERY TO NASA FOR HOT HYDROGEN TESTING"

OUR STRATEGY FOR PFRC HAS EVOLVED SINCE OUR PHASE I PROPOSAL, AND WE NOW PROPOSE A HYBRID MAGNET APPROACH: A COMBINATION OF SO-CALLED  DRY  CONDUCTION-COOLED LOW-TEMPERATURE (LTS) SUPERCONDUCTOR MAGNETS AND HIGH-TEMPERATURE (HTS) MAGNETS THAT ARE OPERATED AT LOW TEMPERATURE FOR MAXIMUM CURRENT AT HIGH FIELDS. CONDUCTION-COOLED LTS MAGNETS ARE BECOMING STATE-OF-THE-ART FOR MRI MACHINES, AND REDUCE COOLANT REQUIREMENTS FROM 1000 S OF LITERS OF HELIUM OVER THE LIFETIME OF THE MACHINE TO A FEW LITERS IN A CLOSED CRYOCOOLER. THIS IS WITH A MASS PENALTY FOR COOLING OF ONLY ABOUT 5%. THESE LOWCOOLANT LTS MAGNETS, PRODUCING A FIELD OF 5 TO 6 T, WILL HAVE EXCELLENT SAFETY MARGIN IN BOTH CRITICAL CURRENT AND FIELD AND WILL HAVE A CLEAR PATH TO SPACE APPLICATIONS. PFRC ALSO REQUIRES HIGHER-FIELD NOZZLE MAGNETS PRODUCING FIELDS OF 20 TO 30 T. THESE WOULD UTILIZE HTS SUPERCONDUCTORS OPERATED AT LOW TEMPERATURES OF ABOUT 10 K. ALL COILS WILL REQUIRE HIGHLY EFFICIENT COOLING SYSTEMS, EXCELLENT MECHANICAL SUPPORT, AND OVERALL LOW MASS INCLUDING STRUCTURAL COMPONENTS. OUR PARTNER, PPPL, IS THE ONLY INSTITUTION IN THE WORLD WHERE ACTIVE RESEARCH ON THE PHYSICS AND TECHNOLOGY OF SMALL, STEADY-STATE FUSION DEVICES IS BEING PERFORMED. WE PROPOSE A PHASE II EXPERIMENT TO BUILD A 0.5 TESLA LTS MAGNET WITH A SPLIT PAIR OF WINDING PACKS, TO MIMIC A SUBSET OF THE PFRC MAGNETS. A SEPARATE PULSED COPPER TEST COIL TO SIMULATION THE PLASMA WILL BE USED TO STUDY THE EFFECTS ON THE MAGNET OF FRC FORMATION, WHICH WILL OCCUR IN A FRACTION OF A SECOND AND RESULT IN LARGE INCREASES IN MAGNETIC FIELD AT THE WINDINGS. IN PARALLEL, WE WILL CONTINUE TO ADVANCE THE DESIGN OF THE HTS NOZZLE MAGNETS, SEEKING THE LOWEST MASS SOLUTION."

A MINIATURE LDMS, HAS BEEN DEVELOPED FOR THE MARS-ORGANIC-MOLECULE-ANALYZER (MOMA) INSTRUMENT AT NASA-GSFC FOR THE EXOMARS MISSION, EXPECTED TO LAUNCH IN 2020. THE MOMA INSTRUMENT HAS A UV LASER THAT IS AT LEAST THREE TIMES BIGGER IN SIZE COMPARED TO THE Q-PEAK LASER. THE MOMA INSTRUMENT CAN BE USED IN FUTURE MISSIONS TO TITAN AND EUROPA TO STUDY THE THOLINS AND ICY WATER. FOR MISSION LIKE EUROPA-LANDER A RADIATION HARDENED INSTRUMENT IS NEEDED AND IN THIS PROGRAM Q-PEAK WILL MAKE THE SUITABLE LASER. THE LASER WILL HAVE A MODULAR FORM FACTOR TO PRODUCE 1064-NM AS THE FUNDAMENTAL WAVELENGTH AND THEN FREQUENCY-UPCONVERT IN TWO STAGES; SECOND-HARMONIC-GENERATION TO PRODUCE 532 NM AND FOURTH-HARMONIC-GENERATION 266-NM USING THE APPROPRIATE NONLINEAR CRYSTALS. WHEN THE LASER IS SET TO PRODUCE 532-NM, IT IS SUITABLE TO PERFORM RAMAN-SPECTROSCOPY AS A COMPLEMENTARY ANALYSIS OF ORGANIC MOLECULES. WHEN SET TO PRODUCE 1064-NM, IT IS SUITABLE FOR LASER-INDUCEDBREAKDOWN- SPECTROSCOPY WHICH IS ANOTHER TECHNIQUE TO PERFORM COMPOSITIONAL ANALYSIS OF ORGANIC/INORGANIC SAMPLES."

BASED ON THE SUCCESS OF THE CURRENT MARS SCIENCE LABORATORY ROVER INSTRUMENT CHEMCAM, THE FIRST EVER LASER-BASED SPECTROGRAPHIC SYSTEM TO BE SELECTED AS AN INSTRUMENT ON A NASA SPACECRAFT, THE HAWAII INSTITUTE OF GEOPHYSICS AND PLANETOLOGY (HIGP) HAS DEVELOPED AND TESTED A PROTOTYPE INSTRUMENT. THIS NEW INSTRUMENT IS CAPABLE OF AT LEAST 10,000 TIMES GREATERSENSITIVITY THAN THE CHEMCAM INSTRUMENT, ALLOWING FASTER MEASUREMENTS UP TO 8 M AWAY WITH A FOCUSED LASER BEAM. THIS INTEGRATED, COMPACT REMOTE INSTRUMENT IS CALLED THE COMPACTINTEGRATED INSTRUMENT FOR REMOTE SPECTROSCOPY ANALYSIS (CIIRSA). REPLACING THE EXISTING LASER WITH THE Q-PEAK PROPOSED LASER WILL REDUCE CIIRSA''S WEIGHT BY 30 % AND VOLUME BY 20 %. IN PHASE II, Q-PEAK WILL DESIGN, DEVELOP AND BUILD A LASER THAT WILL PRODUCE 5 MJ OF ENERGY IN<2 NS PULSE DURATION AT 523 NM AND OUR PARTNER HIGP WILL FURTHER DEVELOP COMPACT AND HIGH RESOLUTION SPECTROGRAPH.

Q-PEAK''S LOW SWAP AND HIGHER ENERGY LASER WILL EXTEND THE DYNAMIC RANGE OF SIGMA SPACE''S LIDAR INSTRUMENT TO>10 KM. FOR NASA JPL, SIGMA SPACE COMPLETED A DESIGN STUDY OF POTENTIAL LIDAR SOLUTIONS FOR A LANDER. IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT THE CHALLENGING LIDAR REQUIREMENTS COULD BE MET WITH A LASER OF ABOUT 1W AVERAGE POWER, USING SHORT PULSES IN THE GREEN AT A PRF OF #tilde#30 KHZ. THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE TO THIS APPLICATION IS THE LIMITED MASS AND THE HIGH RADIATION ENVIRONMENT. Q-PEAK PROPOSES TO DEVELOP A 1-W LASER THAT HAS A VOLUME<8 C.C AND A WEIGHT<20 G. THE SWAP IS AT LEAST AN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE LOWER COMPARED TO THE COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE LASER SOURCE. THE MODULAR FORM FACTOR ALLOWS THE LASER TO BE EASILY MODIFIED TO PRODUCE DIFFERENT WAVELENGTHS BY FREQUENCY UP CONVERSION. THE ULTRA-COMPACT LASER ALONG WITH THE SINGLE PHOTON LIDAR WILL FIND DIRECT AND IMMEDIATE APPLICATION ON AT LEAST TWO MORE NASA MISSIONS - RESTORE-L AND ARRM. RESTORE-L IS AN AMBITIOUS ENDEAVOR TO LAUNCH A ROBOTIC SPACECRAFT IN 2020 TO REFUEL A LIVE SATELLITE IN LOW-EARTH ORBIT AND DEMONSTRATE A SUITE OF SATELLITE-SERVICING TECHNOLOGIES, POTENTIALLY INCLUDING A SATELLITE LASER RANGEFINDER USING THE SAME LASER. THE ASTEROID REDIRECT ROBOTIC MISSION (ARRM) IS DESIGNED TO SEND ASTRONAUTS TO VISIT A LARGE NEAR-EARTH ASTEROID, EXPLORE IT AND RETURN WITH SAMPLES IN THE 2020S.

JOHNSON, PRESIDENT OF DEPENDABLE SYSTEM TECHNOLOGIES, LLC (DST), PLAN TO DEVELOP TECHNIQUES AND THE CONCOMITANT SOFTWARE MODULES FOR ENABLING MODELING AND VISUALIZATION IN QSI S TEAMS  TOOLSET TO REPRESENT THE ENTIRE FM DESIGN AS PART OF A SYSTEM DESIGN. THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THE PROPOSED EFFORT IS TO HAVE TEAMS  COMPLETE THE CONTROL LOOP IN TERMS OF INCORPORATING THE  RESPONSE  (THE  R  IN FDIR) LOOPS AS PART OF ITS DESIGN AND ANALYSES OF FM ARCHITECTURE. THIS WILL INCLUDE IMPROVEMENTS TO ADDRESS FM METRICS FOR FAILURE RESPONSE/RECOVERY, AND WILL BE LINKED TO ONGOING EFFORTS TO IMPLEMENT FM METRICS AND TO OVERALL SYSTEM AUTONOMY, BUT TARGETING SMD SCIENCE MISSIONS AND THEIR UNIQUE GOALS. THE PROPOSED EFFORT WILL RESULT IN A NOVEL CAPABILITY THAT INCORPORATES THE  RECOVERY  ASPECT OF FDIR WITHIN TEAMS  AND ENABLES FM VISUALIZATION OF DESIGN ARCHITECTURES, WHICH THEN LINKS TO A CLEAR AND CONCISE SET OF FM METRICS TO MINIMIZE MISSION RISKS TO DESIRED LEVELS. TEAMS  CAN LEVERAGE BUILT-IN MODELING FEATURES FOR PERFORMING FM ARCHITECTURE DESIGN ASSESSMENT, SUCH AS FAULT TREES AND FM METRICS RELATED TO FAILURE DETECTION AND ISOLATION. SWITCHES IN TEAMS  MODELS FACILITATE THEIR USE IN MULTIPLE SYSTEM MODES. THIS FEATURE WILL BE LEVERAGED TO ENABLE RECOVERY LOOPS ACROSS MULTIPLE SCENARIOS. THE PROPOSED EFFORT SEEKS TO AID THE VISUALIZATION AND ASSESSMENT OF FM DESIGN FOR SYSTEM(S) IN MULTIPLE USAGE SCENARIOS BY UTILIZING EXISTING CAPABILITIES AND INTRODUCING NEW CAPABILITIES TO TEAMS  FOR THE COMPUTATION AND EVOLUTION OF RELEVANT FM ANALYSES. THE ADDED CAPABILITIES INCLUDE INFORMATION INTEGRATION EXTENDING THE SYSTEM MODELING CAPABILITIES AND ASSESSING THE EFFECT OF IMPLEMENTING DIAGNOSTIC DECISIONS ON THE OVERALL FUNCTIONALITY OF THE SYSTEM."

AS PART OF THE CURRENT U.S. PARTICIPATING INVESTIGATOR (USPI) PROJECT, RSS RELEASED ITS FIRST VERSION OF OCEAN PRODUCTS IN JANUARY 2014. THE PROPOSED INVESTIGATION WILL (1) CONTINUE THE PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION OF THE AMSR2 OCEAN PRODUCTS, (2) MONITOR THE QUALITY OF THE AMSR2 BRIGHTNESS TEMPERATURE (TB) AND OP VIA ONGOING VALIDATION, AND (3) IMPLEMENT A NUMBER OF IMPROVEMENTS TO ENHANCE THE SCIENTIFIC USAGE OF THE OCEAN PRODUCTS. THE PROPOSED IMPROVEMENTS ARE: 1. IMPROVE AMSR2 TB CALIBRATION 2. RETRIEVE SST AND WIND SPEED THROUGH RAIN 3. IMPLEMENT RADIO FREQUENCY INTERFERENCE (RFI) MITIGATION 4. REMOVE SUN GLITTER 5. INCLUDE ERROR BARS ON THE RETRIEVALS ONE OF THE GREATEST CONSEQUENCES OF OUR WARMING CLIMATE WILL LIKELY BE RELATED TO CHANGES IN THE HYDROLOGIC CYCLE AND GENERAL CIRCULATION. DROUGHTS, FLOODS, AND SEVERE STORMS HAVE ENORMOUS IMPACTS ON SOCIETY. OF ALL SPACEBORNE SENSORS, PROBABLY NONE PROVIDE A MORE COMPLETE AND RELEVANT ARRAY OF ESSENTIAL CLIMATE VARIABLES FOR STUDYING THESE HYDROLOGIC PROCESSES THAN MICROWAVE (MW) RADIOMETERS SUCH AS NASA S TMI/GMI AND JAXA S AMSR-E/AMSR2. OVER THE WORLD S OCEANS THESE SATELLITE MW RADIOMETERS TAKE HIGHLY ACCURATE MEASUREMENTS OF SEA-SURFACE TEMPERATURE (SST) AND WIND, TOTAL WATER VAPOR AND CLOUD WATER, AND RAIN RATE, ALL OF WHICH ARE INDICATORS OF VARIABILITY IN THE HYDROLOGIC CYCLE AND GENERAL CIRCULATION. THIS COLLECTION OF SATELLITE RETRIEVALS IS CALLED THE OCEAN PRODUCTS EARTH SYSTEM DATA RECORD (OP-ESDR), AND IT EXTENDS FROM 1987 TO PRESENT (MW SST STARTS IN 1997). AMSR2 IS A PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF THE OP-ESDR. IT EXTENDS THE OP-ESDR FOR PROBABLY ANOTHER 10 YEARS AND HAS SEVERAL ADVANCEMENTS OVER ITS PREDECESSOR AMSR-E, INCLUDING ADDITIONAL CHANNELS AT 7.3 GHZ, A BETTER DESIGNED HOT LOAD FOR IMPROVED CALIBRATION, AND A LARGER ANTENNA FOR HIGHER SPATIAL RESOLUTIONS. AS SUCH, AMSR2 REPRESENTS THE MOST CAPABLE MW IMAGING RADIOMETER TO DATE. OTHER THAN WINDSAT WHICH HAS A VERY NARROW SWATH, AMSR2 IS CURRENTLY THE ONLY SATELLITE SENSOR IN OPERATION THAT IS PROVIDING THROUGH-CLOUD SST RETRIEVALS ON A GLOBAL BASIS. MW SST RETRIEVALS ARE ESSENTIAL TO CLIMATE RESEARCH IN THAT THEY ARE FREE OF ATMOSPHERIC ERRORS AND SAMPLING BIASES DUE TO WATER VAPOR, NON-RAINING CLOUDS, AND AEROSOLS."

      "description": "IGF::OT::IGFTHIS NASA RESEARCH ANNOUNCEMENT AWARD IS FOR THE PRODUCTION AND STUDY OF OCEAN VECTOR WINDS FROM SOIL MOISTURE ACTIVE-PASSIVE (SMAP) WITH A FOCUS ON TROPICAL AND EXTRA-TROPICAL CYCLONES OVER THE OCEAN. AS COMPARED TO MOST OTHER SATELLITE WIND SENSORS, SMAP HAS THE UNIQUE CAPABILITY TO MEASURE HIGH WINDS THROUGH HEAVY RAIN IN STORMS. SMAP COMBINES THE PASSIVE THROUGH-RAIN L-BAND CAPABILITY OF AQUARIUS WITH THE TWO-LOOK POLARIMETRIC CAPABILITY OF WINDSAT INTO A SENSOR THAT IS VERY WELL SUITED FOR MEASURING OCEAN STORM WINDS. WE WANT TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY AND ADAPT AND APPLY OUR EXISTING RETRIEVAL ALGORITHMS TO SMAP IN ORDER TO PROVIDE THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY WITH A UNIQUE OCEAN VECTOR WIND DATASET. THE PROPOSED INVESTIGATION WILL CONSIST OF: 1) THE AQUARIUS/WINDSAT VECTOR WIND ALGORITHM ADAPTATION TO SMAP; AND 2) AN EXTENSIVE WIND VALIDATION BASED ON COLLOCATED PRODUCTS FROM OTHER SATELLITES AND INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING THE AIRBORNE STEP FREQUENCY MICROWAVE RADIOMETER (SFMR), NCEP GDAS, AND MEASUREMENTS FROM MOORED BUOYS. EACH SMAP RETRIEVED OCEAN VECTOR WIND WE PRODUCE WILL BE ACCOMPANIED BY A QUANTITATIVE ESTIMATE OF ITS RANDOM AND SYSTEMATIC UNCERTAINTIES, WHOSE VALUES WE OBTAIN BY RUNNING THE RETRIEVAL ALGORITHM WITH PERTURBED CONDITIONS. AN ATBD DESCRIBING DETAILS OF THE ALGORITHM STEPS WILL BE PRODUCED AS WELL AS A VALIDATION REPORT AND SCIENTIFIC PAPERS DESCRIBING OUR RESULTS AND PRODUCTS. THE WIND DATA WILL BE DISTRIBUTED TO THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY THROUGH WEB AND FTP SITES. USER SUPPORT WILL BE PROVIDED. OUR PROPOSED VECTOR WIND RETRIEVAL ALGORITHM WILL INGEST ONLY SMAP RADIOMETER BRIGHTNESS TEMPERATURE MEASUREMENTS WITHOUT USING RADAR DATA. PART OF THE STUDY WILL INCLUDE EVALUATING THE LIMITED TIME PERIOD OVER WHICH RADAR BACKSCATTER MEASUREMENTS WERE AVAILABLE AND ASSESS THE PERFORMANCE ENHANCEMENT IN OCEAN VECTOR WIND RETRIEVALS THAT CAN BE OBTAINED BY COMBINING ACTIVE AND PASSIVE SMAP MEASUREMENTS."

THE INVESTIGATION TO BE CONDUCTED UNDER THIS CONTRACT IS A CONTINUATION OF THE GMI INVESTIGATION THAT WAS FUNDED THROUGH ROSES 2013: PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY SOLICITATION. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE INVESTIGATION IS TO CONTINUE THE PRODUCTION, VALIDATION, AND UTILIZATION OF THE GEOPHYSICAL RETRIEVALS FROM THE GLOBAL PRECIPITATION MEASUREMENT MISSION (GPM) MICROWAVE IMAGER (GMI), WHICH WAS LAUNCHED IN FEBRUARY 2014. THE GMI OBSERVATIONS ARE BEING USED TO PRODUCE SETS OF FIVE AIR-SEA (AS) VARIABLES, ALL OF WHICH ARE CLASSIFIED AS ESSENTIAL CLIMATE VARIABLES (ECV) BY THE GLOBAL OBSERVING SYSTEM FOR CLIMATE (GCOS):1. SEA-SURFACE TEMPERATURE (SST, C), (MICROWAVE THROUGH-CLOUD RETRIEVALS)2. NEAR-SURFACE OCEAN WINDS (M/S)3. TOTAL WATER VAPOR ABOVE THE OCEAN (MM)4. TOTAL CLOUD WATER ABOVE THE OCEAN (MM)5. SEA-SURFACE RAIN RATE (MM/HR)HEREIN, THESE DATA PRODUCTS ARE REFERRED TO AS AS-ECV.THE GMI AS-ECV HAVE BEEN INTERCALIBRATED WITH SIMILAR RETRIEVALS FROM 3 OTHER MICROWAVE IMAGERS (TMI, AMSR-2, AND WINDSAT) AND ARE NOW AN ESSENTIAL COMPONENT OF THE 30-YEAR AS CLIMATE DATA RECORD (AS-CDR). GMI HAS AN ADVANCED ON-BOARD CALIBRATION SYSTEM, AND ITS INCLINED ORBIT PROVIDES PRECISE COLLOCATIONS WITH THE OTHER MICROWAVE IMAGERS (MI). ACCORDINGLY, WE EXPECT GMI WILL BE THE ABSOLUTE CALIBRATION REFERENCE FOR THE AS-CDR FOR THE NEXT 1 TO 2 DECADES. THE AS-ECV FROM GMI AND ALL THE OTHER MIS ARE FREELY AVAILABLE VIA THE INTERNET.THIS EFFORT PROPOSES THE FOLLOWING IMPROVEMENTS TO THE GMI PROCESSING ALGORITHMS, WHICH WILL BE IMPLEMENTED TOWARDS THE END OF THE INVESTIGATION:1. MITIGATION OF SUN GLITTER CONTAMINATION2. FURTHER MITIGATION OF RADIO FREQUENCY INTERFERENCE3. ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR BARS TO AS-ECV4. EXTENDING THE AS-ECV CLOSER TO LAND (EXPERIMENTAL)A UNIQUE FEATURE OF GMI (AND ITS PREDECESSOR TMI) IS THAT IT SAMPLES THE ENTIRE 24-HOUR DIURNAL CYCLE OF AIR-SEA INTERACTIONS. THE PROPER CHARACTERIZATION OF DIURNAL VARIABILITY IS ESSENTIAL TO UNDERSTANDING THE PLANET''S MOST FUNDAMENTAL HARMONIC.  THE ACCURATE REPRESENTATION OF THE COUPLING OF THE OCEANS AND ATMOSPHERE CONTINUES TO BE A MAJOR CHALLENGE FOR CLIMATE MODELS.  THE AS-CDR IS PARTICULARLY WELL SUITED FOR STUDYING THESE ISSUES BECAUSE IT PROVIDES UNIQUE INFORMATION ON THE AIR-SEA EXCHANGE OF MOMENTUM, ENERGY, AND MOISTURE OVER THE LAST 3 DECADES."

      "description": "NASA RESEARCH ANNOUCEMENT (NRA) FOR MOODULAR GENERALIZED FRAMEWORK FOR ASSESSING AIRCRAFT AERO-PROPULSIVE, STABILITY, AND CONTROL CHARACTERISTICS  NASA CONTINUES TO INVESTIGATE THE POTENTIAL OF ADVANCED, INNOVATIVE PROPULSION AND AIRFRAME CONCEPTS TO IMPROVE EFFICIENCY FOR FUEL AND NOISE REDUCTION AND TO ENABLE NEW VISIONS FOR FLEXIBLE, ON-DEMAND TRAVEL FOR THE PUBLIC. THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF ADVANCED VEHICLE DESIGNS SUCH AS BLENDED WING BODIES AND DISTRIBUTED ELECTRIC PROPULSION HAVE LONG BEEN KNOWN, BUT THESE DESIGNS HAVE BEEN SLOW TO TRANSITION INTO THE COMMERCIAL AND PUBLIC DOMAIN BECAUSE OF GAPS IN THE ABILITY TO EFFICIENTLY AND RELIABLY MODEL THEM IN THE DESIGN TOOL SETS. MODELING THESE DESIGNS IS PARTICULARLY CHALLENGING FOR THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN PHASE WHERE MISSION TARGETS AND PERFORMANCE GOALS ARE FIRST TRANSLATED INTO POTENTIAL AIRCRAFT DESIGNS THAT CAN MEET THOSE GOALS. HOWEVER, CONCEPTUAL DESIGN AND ANALYSIS OF UNCONVENTIONAL AIRFRAME (GEOMETRIES THAT DIFFER FROM THE HISTORICALLY POPULAR  WING-AND-TUBE  DESIGN OR WHICH TAKE ADVANTAGE OF FLOW AUGMENTATION TO IMPROVE LIFT/DRAG CHARACTERISTICS) AND UNCONVENTIONAL PROPULSION (ENERGY FROM SOURCES OTHER THAN CARBON LIQUID FUEL) CONCEPTS AND TECHNOLOGIES ARE CURRENTLY USED WITHIN NASA FOR TECHNOLOGY PORTFOLIO INVESTMENT PLANNING, DEVELOPMENT OF ADVANCED CONCEPTS TO PROVIDE TECHNOLOGY PULL, AND INDEPENDENT TECHNICAL ASSESSMENT OF NEW CONCEPTS. NASA S SYSTEMS ANALYSTS NEED IMPROVED CONCEPTUAL DESIGN AND ANALYSIS TOOLS TO SUPPORT THESE EFFORTS. MANY TRADITIONAL METHODS OF SIZING AIRCRAFT CONTROL SURFACES AND ASSURING ACCEPTABLE HANDLING QUALITIES HAVE LOST THEIR VALIDITY AS MORE UNCONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT ARE BEING STUDIED, AND ADDITIONAL DYNAMIC MODES MIGHT BECOME UNSTABLE. NASA IS SEEKING TO DEVELOP METHODS FOR ANALYSIS OF AIRCRAFT STATIC AND DYNAMIC STABILITY CHARACTERISTICS SUITABLE FOR UNCONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT IN THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN STAGE. THE METHODS SHOULD BE VERIFIED AND DEMONSTRATED THROUGH SIMULATION OF THE DYNAMICS OF UNCONVENTIONAL FIXED-WING AIRCRAFT CONFIGURATIONS WITH TIGHT COUPLING OF PROPULSION AND AERODYNAMICS CHARACTERISTICS, INCLUDING EVALUATION OF ACTIVE CONTROL SYSTEMS TO ENABLE DESIGN OF UNCONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT. THIS STATEMENT OF WORK IS THE RESULT OF A PROPOSAL SUBMITTED BY RESEARCH IN FLIGHT, LLC FOR AWARD UNDER THE NASA HEADQUARTERS ARMD NASA RESEARCH ANNOUNCEMENT (NRA) ENTITLED RESEARCH OPPORTUNITIES IN AERONAUTICS 2018, AMENDMENT NNH18ZEA001N, SUBTOPIC 2.1.6. THE CONTRACTOR SHALL DEVELOP TOOLS, PROCESSES, AND METHODS THAT ALLOW THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGNER OR ANALYST TO ASSESS AND EVALUATE THE STABILITY AND CONTROL CHARACTERISTICS OF UNCONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT CONFIGURATIONS."

FLIGHTSTREAM USES CAD OR AN UNSTRUCTURED SURFACE MESH AND IS ADAPTABLE TO SUBPANELS VARYING IN VERTEX VALENCE FROM TRIANGLES TO SURFACE POLYGONS. THE FOCUS OF THE RECENTLY COMPLETED PHASE-I EFFORT PRECEDING THIS PROPOSAL HAS BEEN TO DEVELOP THE VISCOUS FORMULATION OF SURFACE-VORTICITY TO ALLOW THE PREDICTION OF NON-LINEAR AERODYNAMICS AND THE ONSET OF FLOW SEPARATION THROUGH A NEW APPROACH CALLED THE FLUID STRAIN-BASED SEPARATION MODEL. THIS THEORETICAL DEVELOPMENT AND DEMONSTRATION HAS LAID THE FOUNDATION FOR AN EFFECTIVE, HIGH-FIDELITY, PHYSICS-BASED SOLUTION FOR FLOW SEPARATION. IN THIS PHASE-II PROPOSAL, THE FOCUS IS TO EXPAND THE SCOPE OF APPLICATION OF THESE NON-LINEAR AERODYNAMICS AND FLOW SEPARATION MODELS THROUGH ROBUST ALGORITHMIC IMPLEMENTATION TO THE FLIGHTSTREAM CODE BASE. A PART OF THIS FOCUS WILL ALSO BE TO VALIDATE THE CONCLUSIONS OBTAINED FROM THE STRAIN-BASED SEPARATION MODEL ABOUT THE NATURE OF FLUID FLOW AND TO DEVELOP FUNDAMENTAL RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE PROPOSED MAXIMUM FLUID STRAIN PROPERTY AND THE PRIMARY FLUID PROPERTIES WITH REGARD TO FLOW SEPARATION. SEVERAL MAJOR PERFORMANCE AND FIDELITY ENHANCEMENTS ARE ALSO PROPOSED FOR THIS EFFORT THAT ARE EXPECTED TO PLACE FLIGHTSTREAM IN A VERY UNIQUE POSITION IN THE AEROSPACE INDUSTRY. THESE INCLUDE THE APPLICATION OF THE FAST MULTIPOLE METHOD FOR IMPROVING THE SOLVER SPEED AND REDUCING ITS MEMORY FOOTPRINT; A HIGHER-ORDER VORTICITY SHEET SOLVER TO IMPROVE THE FIDELITY OF THE SOLUTIONS AND IMPROVE SOLVER STABILITY IN NON-LINEAR FLOW ENVIRONMENTS AND OTHER MUTUALLY SUPPORTING ENHANCEMENTS.

OUR INNOVATION PROVIDES ACCESS TO THAT INFORMATION, IN REAL-TIME, AND WITH THE BUILT-IN ANALYTICS TO USE THAT INFORMATION TO IDENTIFY ANOMALIES AND PROVIDE ALERTS. WHEN COMBINED WITH THE OTHER FACTORS INCLUDED IN OUR RISK STATE ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK, OUR INNOVATION WOULD HAVE IDENTIFIED RECENT CRASHES SUCH AS ASIANA 214 AND UPS 1354 AS HIGH RISK FLIGHTS, BEFORE THE EVENTS OCCURRED. ROBUST ANALYTICS OFFERS A VISION FOR NAS-WIDE, REAL-TIME SAFETY MONITORING BASED ON ANALYZING CONTROLLER-PILOT VOICE COMMUNICATIONS FOR ANOMALIES AND CLEARANCE DEVIATIONS, AND COMBINING THAT INSIGHT WITH INFORMATION FROM OTHER DATA SOURCES (FLIGHT PLANS, POSITION REPORTS, WEATHER, INFRASTRUCTURE STATUS, AND TRAFFIC DENSITY) THROUGH ADVANCED ANALYTICS WITH CLOUD COMPUTING FOR A SCALABLE, RELIABLE 24/7 SOLUTION."

THE BOOM IS CAPABLE OF MOTOR-LESS SELF-DEPLOYMENT AND LOCK-OUT THROUGH A UNIQUE COMBINATION OF BI-STABLE COMPOSITE LAMINATE DESIGN AND FEATURES THAT INCREASE TORSIONAL RIGIDITY AND DEPLOYED PRECISION AT THE END OF DEPLOYMENT. THE BOOM CAN BE BUILT TO DIAMETERS RANGING BETWEEN 1.6 CM (5/8 IN) AND 2.5 CM (1 IN) AND FULLY DEPLOYED LENGTHS RANGING FROM 0.5 M TO 10 M WHILE BEING PACKAGED IN LESS THAN  -U VOLUME. A LAUNCH-RETENTION MECHANISM IS PROVIDED TO LOCK THE TIP-MOUNTED INSTRUMENT PACKAGE FOR LAUNCH. FOR DEPLOYMENT, THIS LAUNCH RETENTION MECHANISM IS RELEASED AND THE STRAIN ENERGY STORED WITHIN THE HIGH-STRAIN COMPOSITE BOOM DRIVES THE DEPLOYMENT WITH PREDICTABLE AND NEARLY CONSTANT MOTIVE FORCE. DURING PHASE II ROCCOR WILL ADDRESS THE KEY ENGINEERING DEVELOPMENT RISKS, MATURE THE SYSTEM DESIGN TO A CDR LEVEL OF DEVELOPMENT, AND VALIDATE PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES THROUGH A SERIES OF GROUND-BASED QUALIFICATION TESTS ON ENGINEERING DEVELOPMENT UNITS.

PRELIMINARY ANALYSES INDICATE THESE STEPS WILL ACHIEVE MORE THAN A 5X INCREASE IN TRAC BOOM STRUCTURAL MASS EFFICIENCY OVER RECENTLY DEVELOPED HIGH STRAIN COMPOSITE (HSC) TRAC BOOMS, WHILE MAINTAINING AN EXTREMELY COMPACT ROLL STOWED CONFIGURATION THAT LEVERAGES THE SOLAR SAIL MECHANICAL DESIGN HERITAGE ESTABLISHED WITH THE RECENT NANOSAIL D (ALHORN, ET AL [2011]) AND UPCOMING NEA SCOUT TRAC-DEPLOYED SAIL SYSTEMS.

A KEY COMPONENT OF THE STARSHADE STRUCTURAL SYSTEM IS A SERIES OF DIMENSIONALLY STABLE COMPOSITE CABLES (OR SPOKES) THAT CONNECT THE CENTER STRUCTURAL HUB TO THE PERIMETER TRUSS AND LARGELY DETERMINE THE DEPLOYED SHAPE AND STIFFNESS OF THE SYSTEM MUCH LIKE A BICYCLE WHEEL. THERE ARE MANY CHALLENGES IN DEVELOPING THE STARSHADE SPOKE. PERHAPS MOST NOTABLE IS THAT MEETING THE CTE REQUIREMENT NECESSITATES ACCURATE CONTROL OF FIBER VOLUME FRACTION (RESIN CONTENT) TO LESS THAN 1%. ALSO CHALLENGING IS THAT MEETING THE STIFFNESS PRECISION GOAL OF LESS THAN 0.5% VARIATION BETWEEN CABLES DEMANDS THAT MINIMAL FIBER FRAYING AND DAMAGE BE ALLOWED DURING THE TOW SPREADING AND ALIGNMENT PROCESS AND THAT THE NET CROSS SECTION BE MADE IN ONE STEP WITH NO REQUIRED POSTPROCESSING. FURTHERMORE, MEETING THE LENGTH PRECISION GOAL REQUIRES UNCOMMON ASSEMBLY AND END FITTING BONDING METHODOLOGIES. FINALLY, THERE ARE CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH INTEGRATING SUCH HIGH-PERFORMANCE CABLES INTO THE STARSHADE WHILE ENSURING SNAG-FREE DEPLOYMENT AND PROPER ON-ORBIT OPERATION.

THE RESEARCH FOCUS INCLUDES THE SYSTEM-WIDE SAFETY ASSURANCE TECHNOLOGIES (SSAT) PROJECT. UNDER SSAT, THERE IS A TECHNICAL CHALLENGE AREA KNOWN AS ASSURANCE OF FLIGHT CRITICAL SYSTEMS (AFCS). A PRIMARY THRUST OF AFCS RESEARCH IS ADVANCING FORMAL METHODS TECHNOLOGY SO IT CAN SERVE THE NEEDS OF THE AVIONICS COMMUNITY.IN JANUARY 2012, THE RADIO TECHNICAL COMMISSION FOR AERONAUTICS (RTCA) RELEASED SEVERAL DOCUMENTS, PRODUCTS OF RTCA SPECIAL COMMITTEE SC-205, WHICH ARE KEY TO THE FUTURE OF CERTIFICATION OF AVIONICS SOFTWARE. FOREMOST AMONG THESE ARE DO-178C, SOFTWARE CONSIDERATIONS IN AIRBORNE SYSTEMS AND EQUIPMENT CERTIFICATION, AND DO-278A, SOFTWARE INTEGRITY ASSURANCE CONSIDERATIONS FOR COMMUNICATION, NAVIGATION, SURVEILLANCE, AND AIR TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT (CNA/ATM) SYSTEMS. AS THE SUCCESSORS TO DO-178B AND DO-278, THESE DOCUMENTS PROVIDE UPDATED GUIDANCE FOR DEVELOPERS OF AIRBORNE AND GROUND-BASED SOFTWARE.SC-205 ALSO CREATED FOUR SUPPLEMENTS TO ACCOMPANY DO-178C AND DO-278A. ONE OF THESE, FORMAL METHODS SUPPLEMENT TO DO-178C AND DO-278A, HAS BEEN PUBLISHED AS DO-333. FOR THE FIRST TIME, AVIONICS DEVELOPERS WILL HAVE EXTENSIVE GUIDANCE ON APPLYING FORMAL METHODS TECHNOLOGY TO PRODUCE EVIDENCE THAT CERTIFICATION AUTHORITIES CAN ACCEPT FOR CERTIFICATION CREDIT. THIS WILL PROVIDE A PATHWAY FOR THE GRADUAL INTRODUCTION OF FORMAL METHODS INTO THE DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE AND THE EVENTUAL CERTIFICATION OF AIRCRAFT AND ENGINES WHOSE SOFTWARE AIRWORTHINESS IS ASSURED (IN PART) BY FORMAL METHODS.WHILE THE RELEASE OF DO-333 IS AN IMPORTANT EVENT, THERE REMAIN SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES TO THE SUCCESSFUL INFUSION OF FORMAL METHODS INTO DEVELOPMENT AND CERTIFICATION WORKFLOWS. CHIEF AMONG THESE IS THE NEED TO QUALIFY ANY TOOLS USED TO PRODUCE CERTIFICATION EVIDENCE. ANOTHER SUPPLEMENT TO DO-178C AND DO-278A IS DO-330, SOFTWARE TOOL QUALIFICATION CONSIDERATIONS. THIS DOCUMENT ELABORATES THE GENERAL REQUIREMENTS THAT APPLICANTS MUST MEET WHEN USING SOFTWARE TOOLS IN THE GENERATION OF CERTIFICATION EVIDENCE.USE OF FORMAL METHODS TOOLS IS RELATIVELY NEW IN SOFTWARE CERTIFICATION. MOREOVER, THESE TOOLS MAKE USE OF MATHEMATICALLY RIGOROUS ANALYSES AND TYPICALLY INCLUDE SOPHISTICATED HEURISTIC SEARCH ALGORITHMS. AS A RESULT, THERE ARE QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW TO APPLY THE DO-330 GUIDANCE TO THIS CLASS OF TOOL. THERE IS A NEED TO IDENTIFY AND EXAMINE THE ISSUES SURROUNDING THE APPLICATION OF DO-330 TO FORMAL METHODS TOOLS SO THAT THEIR INTRODUCTION INTO THE CERTIFICATION DOMAIN CAN PROCEED AS SMOOTHLY AS POSSIBLE.IN ADDITION TO THE SPECIFIC REALM OF DO-330, THERE IS ALSO THE MORE GENERAL QUESTION OF FORMAL METHODS TOOL ASSURANCE, WHICH HAS RECEIVED LIMITED ATTENTION BY RESEARCHERS IN THE PAST. THE EMERGENCE OF A CERTIFICATION ROLE FOR FORMAL METHODS, ALBEIT ONE LIKELY TO REMAIN LIMITED INITIALLY, LEADS NATURALLY TO RESEARCH QUESTIONS ABOUT MORE ADVANCED APPLICATIONS OF THE TOOLS. 2.0 SCOPE OF WORK: THE SCOPE OF THE INVESTIGATION INCLUDES BOTH THE GENERAL PROBLEM OF ACHIEVING CONFIDENCE IN FORMAL"

RECENT DATA INDICATES THAT A 100 FOOT LENGTH OF INSULATION MADE BY THIS METHOD IS CONSISTENT FROM START TO FINISH, AND THAT THE SAME INSULATION CAN BE DUPLICATED SEVERAL MONTHS LATER IN A SEPARATE RUN. THE THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY APPEARS TO BE AS GOOD OR BETTER THAN OFFTHE- SHELF (OTS) AEROGEL INSULATIONS THAT ARE THICKER AND LESS FLEXIBLE. THIS SUCCESS FOLLOWS HUNDREDS OF EXPERIMENTS TO FIRST DEMONSTRATE A GOOD INSULATION RECIPE USING SINGLE SHEET MOLDS IN THE LABORATORY, FOLLOWED BY PILOT RUNS ON A 12-INCH WIDE SYSTEM TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THE RECIPE COULD BE RUN IN A CONTINUOUS PROCESS. BECAUSE THE INSULATION IS ONLY 0.5 MM THICK, ITS NOT NEARLY AS STRONG AS THE 5 MM THICK OTS INSULATION USED AS OUR BENCHMARK. AS A REMEDY, WE HAVE ADDED SCRIM TO THE INSULATION IN SHORT SECTIONS BY HAND IN THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS. WHILE THIS SOLVED THE STRENGTH PROBLEM, IT IS A STEP BACKWARDS IN TERMS OF MANUFACTURING READINESS BECAUSE SCRIM IS NOW FED BY HAND INTO A PROCESS THAT IS OTHERWISE MACHINE CONTROLLED. THE FINAL STEPS NEEDED TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THE TECHNOLOGY CAN BE SCALED IS TO A) PRODUCE THE INSULATION WITH A SCRIM IN A CONTINUOUS PROCESS AND B) PRODUCE THE INSULATION IN A WIDER WIDTH ON A PRODUCTION SYSTEM. DEMONSTRATING THESE CAPABILITIES IS THE GOAL OF THIS PROPOSED PHASE II-X EFFORT."

THE RELATIVE MAGNITUDE OF THE TWO VARIES DEPENDING ON ALTITUDE, TEMPERATURE AND THE PLANET. USUALLY RADIATION IS MORE SIGNIFICANT AT LOWER PRESSURES AND AT HIGHER TEMPERATURES. GAS CONDUCTION IS MORE DOMINANT AT HIGHER PRESSURES AND LOWER TEMPERATURES. IN MOST PLANETARY ENTRIES, BOTH MODES OF HEAT TRANSFER ARE SIGNIFICANT. TYPICAL FLEXIBLE OR RIGID REFRACTORY CERAMIC FIBER THERMAL PROTECTION SYSTEM (TPS) SUCH AS ADVANCED FLEXIBLE REUSABLE SURFACE INSULATION (AFRSI) AND SHUTTLE TILES CAN TAKE HIGH TEMPERATURES, CAN REDUCE GAS CONDUCTION AT LOWER PRESSURES, AND SCATTER RADIATION AT HIGHER TEMPERATURES. THERE IS A NEED FOR MORE EFFICIENT TPS WITH LOWER MASS, REDUCED THICKNESS AND SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY TO MAKE INTER PLANETARY MISSIONS POSSIBLE. IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL, INSULATIONS NEED TO BE DEVELOPED THAT CAN FURTHER REDUCE GAS CONDUCTION AND RADIATION HEAT TRANSFER COMPARED TO STANDARD REFRACTORY CERAMIC FIBER INSULATIONS. THE OVERALL OBJECTIVE OF THE PHASE II PROGRAM IS TO MIGRATE AND OPTIMIZE PROVEN PAPER MAKING CONCEPTS TO FABRICATE ROBUST, FLEXIBLE AND COST EFFICIENT, FIBER REINFORCED AEROGELS, WITHOUT SACRIFICING THE THERMAL AND MECHANICAL QUALITIES, IN LARGE SECTIONS SUITABLE FOR APPLICATION ON HIGH SPEED VEHICLES (HSV?S). FURTHER INVESTIGATION IN PHASE II WOULD FOCUS ON PRODUCTION METHODS AND RECIPE OPTIMIZATION FOR THIS NEW CLASS OF THERMAL INSULATIONS.

THE ADVANTAGES AND BENEFITS OF LARGE SOLAR ARRAY DESIGNS WILL ONLY BE REALIZED IF THE ARRAY SUPPORT STRUCTURE WEIGHT AND PACKAGING VOLUME ARE MINIMIZED. SDC''S ADVANCED COMPOSITE TRUSS (ACT) ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY CAN PROVIDE A 30-40% WEIGHT SAVINGS AND A 250-300% IMPROVEMENT IN POWER PER UNIT VOLUME OVER EXISTING STATE-OF- THE-ART SOLAR ARRAY BOOM STRUCTURES. THE ACT TECHNOLOGY CONSISTS OF THE LIGHTWEIGHT ADVANCED COMPOSITE TRUSS, THE AUTONOMOUS LOW-PACKING VOLUME ACT PRINTER, AND AN INTEGRATED SOLAR ARRAY DEPLOYMENT SYSTEM. THE WEIGHT OF THE ACT STRUCTURE IS DESIGNED TO OPTIMIZE THE LOAD CARRYING PATH WITHIN AN OPEN TRUSS ARCHITECTURE. THE MATERIAL FOR THE TRUSS IS EFFICIENTLY PACKAGED WITHIN THE ENVELOPE OF THE ACT PRINTER PRIOR TO LAUNCH. ONCE IN ORBIT, THE ACT PRINTER AUTONOMOUSLY MANUFACTURES THE ACT STRUCTURE WITHOUT THE NEED FOR MECHANICAL JOINTS. THE ACT PRINTER CAN BE SCALED TO MANUFACTURE ANY SIZE, LENGTH, AND/OR GEOMETRY TRUSS REQUIRED TO MEET THE PRESCRIBED MISSION REQUIREMENTS. FOLLOWING THE MANUFACTURE OF THE ACT TRUSS, THE INTEGRATED DRIVE SYSTEM OF THE ACT PRINTER AUTONOMOUSLY DEPLOYS THE SOLAR ARRAY."

      "description": "THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROPOSAL IS FOR THE CALIBRATION AND VALIDATION OFFICE (CVO) TO PROVIDE ANALYSES OF HIGH PERFORMANCE LIQUID CHROMATOGRAPHY (HPLC) ALGAL PIGMENT SAMPLES COLLECTED BY NASA PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATORS (PIS) SUPPORTED BY THE OCEAN BIOLOGY AND BIOGEOCHEMISTRY (OBB) PROGRAM. THE PIGMENT PRODUCTS COVER A SUITE OF CHLOROPHYLLS AND CAROTENOIDS USEFUL TO OCEAN COLOR RESEARCH, IN PARTICULAR THE VALIDATION OF DATA PRODUCTS FROM THE SEA-VIEWING WIDE FIELD-OF-VIEW SENSOR (SEAWIFS) AND THE MODERATE RESOLUTION IMAGING SPECTRORADIOMETER (MODIS). HPLC PIGMENT ANALYSIS IS A COMPLICATED PROCEDURE REQUIRING EXPERT ANALYSIS AND SUBSTANTIAL COSTS FOR PURCHASING, MAINTAINING, AND CALIBRATING THE EQUIPMENT. A CENTRALIZED LABORATORY IS A COST-EFFECTIVE MECHANISM FOR PROVIDING CONSISTENTLY HIGH-QUALITY DATA TO MULTIPLE PIS AND DATABASES, BUT ONLY IF THE FACILITY VIGILANTLY PURSUES EXCELLENCE, MAINTAINS RIGOROUS QUALITY ASSURANCE AND CONTROL (QA AND QC) PROCEDURES AS PART OF A DOCUMENTED QUALITY ASSURANCE PLAN (QAP), ADHERES TO STATED PERFORMANCE METRICS TO MINIMIZE UNCERTAINTIES, AND IS EVALUATED INDEPENDENTLY (TO DETECT BIASES AND PROBLEMS). THE LATTER INCLUDES THE INTERNATIONAL SEAWIFS HPLC ANALYSIS ROUND-ROBIN EXPERIMENT (SEAHARRE), AND ANNUAL INTERCOMPARISONS OF DUPLICATE SAMPLES WITH OTHER QA LABORATORIES, INCLUDING THE PRIMARY MANUFACTURER OF STANDARDS. AN ALGAL CULTURE FACILITY WILL BE ESTABLISHED TO: A) ISOLATE STANDARDS COMMERCIALLY UNAVAILABLE OR NEEDED IN LARGE QUANTITIES, AND B) COLLECT WHOLE FILTERS TO ASSIST IN METHOD DEVELOPMENT, VALIDATION, AND QAP PROCEDURES. ALL DATA PRODUCTS WILL BE DISTRIBUTED WITH LIMIT OF DETECTION AND QUANTITATION (LOD AND LOQ, RESPECTIVELY) ANALYSES, AS WELL AS UNCERTAINTY ESTIMATES. RESEARCH ON NEW METHODS TO IMPROVE PIGMENT IDENTIFICATION AND QUANTITATION WITH THE CURRENT CVO APPROACH BASED ON THE VAN HEUKELEM AND THOMAS (2001) METHOD (VHT) WILL OCCUR IN PARALLEL WITH PRODUCTION ANALYSES. CHANGES IN THE PROCEDURES USED IN PIGMENT OCEANOGRAPHY ARE EXPECTED, ALONG WITH IMPROVEMENTS IN THE PROTOCOLS SUPPORTING NEXT-GENERATION SATELLITE ALGORITHMS, WHICH REQUIRE ADVANCED ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES AND IMPROVED PIGMENT DETECTION. ELEVATED UNCERTAINTIES ARE ASSOCIATED WITH FALSE POSITIVES AND NEGATIVES, PLUS POOR RESOLUTION BETWEEN COELUTING PAIRS. RAPID RESOLUTION LIQUID CHROMATOGRAPHY (RRLC) THE NEXT GENERATION IN LIQUID CHROMATOGRAPHY (LC) WILL BE USED TO IMPROVE THE SEPARATION OF PIGMENTS, AND DEVELOP FASTER METHODS (WHICH PROVIDES MORE ANALYST TIME FOR ALTERNATIVE DETECTION TECHNIQUES). METHOD SPECIFICA-TIONS SUCH AS THE LINEAR GRADIENT,LAG TIME, FLOW RATE, AND COLUMN TEMPERATURE WILL BE MODIFIED BASED ON DRYLAB SIMULATIONS AND ADJUSTMENTS MADE TO IMPROVE EFFICIENCY. THE DETECTION AND ANALYSIS OF PIGMENTS DIFFICULT TO DISTINGUISH BECAUSE OF SIMILARITY IN THEIR SPECTRAL ABSORPTION PROPERTIES WILL BE IMPROVED THROUGH THE USE OF LIQUID CHROMATOGRAPHY COUPLED TO MASS SPECTROMETRY DETECTION (LC-MS). THE CHEMICAL TAXONOMY (CHEMTAX) PROGRAM WILL BE USED TO EVALUATE THE IMPORTANCE OF PIGMENT DATA QUALITY ON CHEMTAX OUTPUT BY COMPARING THE OUTPUT MATRIX OF EXISTING SEAHARRE QA DATA WITH DATA FROM METHODS NOT VALIDATED WITH A PROPER QA CAPABILITY (NV)."

AS SUCH, IT PRESENTS A KEY ENABLING TECHNOLOGY FOR FUTURE DEEP SPACE MISSIONS INCLUDING SPACE APERTURES AT LAGRANGIAN POINTS, AND ORBITING MISSIONS AT ASTEROIDS AND FARAWAY PLANETS AND MOONS.  THE KEY ASPECT OF DISCUS IS TIGHT INTEGRATION OF COMMUNICATIONS WITH RELATIVE LOCALIZATION AND CONTROL. THE PROPOSED RF COMMUNICATIONS ARCHITECTURE PROVIDES A DUAL BENEFIT SINCE THE RF SIGNALS ARE ALSO USED FOR RELATIVE LOCALIZATION BASED ON TOA AND TDOA SENSING MODES. DENSITY CONTROL APPROACH IS HIGHLY ROBUST TO FAILURES OF INDIVIDUAL SPACECRAFT AND HAS THE KEY PROPERTY OF SELF-HEALING, WHICH ALLOWS FOR MISSION CONTINUATION EVEN WITH A REDUCED CAPABILITY. DCA ARE INTEGRATED WITH OUR EFFECTIVE COLLISION DETECTION AND AVOIDANCE ALGORITHMS IMPROVING THE OVERALL SYSTEM SAFETY AND EFFICIENCY. THE CONTINGENCY MITIGATION MODULE MONITORS THE HEALTH OF THE SWARM AND REMOVES FAILED SPACECRAFT IN A SAFE MANNER.

NASA AND BOEING HAVE BEEN STUDYING THE SUITABILITY OF THIS CONCEPT TO ADDRESS THE DRAG REDUCTION PROBLEM IN AIRCRAFT WITH REDUCED-STIFFNESS WINGS. HOWEVER, REDUCED STIFFNESS MAY LEAD TO WING FLUTTER. IN ADDITION, DISPLACEMENTS OF VCCTEF CONTROL SURFACES ARE LIMITED AND SUBJECT TO HIGHLY NONLINEAR AND TIME-VARYING CONSTRAINTS. HENCE CONTROL DESIGN NEEDS TO SOLVE A CONSTRAINED MULTI-OBJECTIVE OPTIMIZATION PROBLEM. TO ADDRESS THESE CHALLENGES, IN PHASE I SSCI CARRIED OUT INITIAL DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING OF THE DRAG IDENTIFICATION AND REDUCTION TECHNOLOGY (DIRECT). THE DIRECT SOFTWARE ESTIMATES WING STRUCTURAL MODES ON-LINE AND USES THAT INFORMATION IN A ROBUST PREDICTIVE CONTROLLER DESIGN. BASED ON USING EVOLUTIONARY OPTIMIZATION AND OFF-LINE ANALYSIS, DIRECT ESTIMATES WIND DISTURBANCES ON-LINE AND SELECTS OPTIMAL CONTROLLER PARAMETERS FROM A TABLE LOOKUP TO ACHIEVE ON-LINE DRAG MINIMIZATION. BUILDING UPON THE SUCCESSFUL PHASE I DEVELOPMENT, IN PHASE II WE PROPOSE TO EXTEND THE DIRECT APPROACH AND EVALUATE ITS PERFORMANCE THROUGH HIGH-FIDELITY SIMULATIONS AND WIND-TUNNEL TESTING. SPECIFIC PHASE II TASKS INCLUDE: (I) TEST PHASE I FLUTTER SUPPRESSION ALGORITHMS AND PSC ALGORITHMS IN A GTM SIMULATION WITH FLEXIBLE MODES AND VCCTEF CONTROL SURFACES; (II) EXTEND AND ENHANCE THE DRAG MINIMIZATION APPROACH BY DEVELOPING INNOVATIVE PERFORMANCE SEEKING CONTROL (PSC) ALGORITHMS; AND (III) COMPARE THE FEATURES OF PSC AND OTHER AVAILABLE PERFORMANCE SEEKING CONTROL ALGORITHMS THROUGH WIND-TUNNEL TESTING AT THE UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON AERODYNAMICS LABORATORY (UWAL).

IN PHASE I WE CONDUCTED A PIXEL TRADE STUDY AND PERFORMANCE EVALUATION FOR A CAPACITIVE TRANS-IMPEDANCE AMPLIFIER (CTIA) AND A SOURCE FOLLOWER PER DETECTOR (SFD) TYPE PIXEL USING ANALOG CIRCUIT SIMULATIONS. THEN WE GENERATED THE OPTIMUM UNIT CELL LAYOUT, DEFINED THE OVERALL ARCHITECTURE AND CREATED THE TOP-LEVEL SCHEMATIC. BY THE END OF PHASE I WE HAVE COMPLETED THE BLUE PRINTS FOR THE DESIGN. THE COMPLETION OF THE TOP-LEVEL SCHEMATICS, VERIFIED THROUGH SIMULATION, IS A CRITICAL MILESTONE IN THE DEVELOPMENT. IT SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCES THE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH CREATING NEW ROIC TECHNOLOGY AND WILL ALLOW US TO EFFICIENTLY FABRICATE AND TEST THE DEVICE IN PHASE II. ALL RESULTS FROM PHASE I ARE DOCUMENTED IN A PRELIMINARY INTERFACE CONTROL DOCUMENT (ICD) SO THAT THE NEW ROIC CAN BE CONSIDERED FOR FUTURE MISSIONS. IN PHASE II WE WILL PRODUCE THE LAYOUT OF THE ENTIRE CHIP FOR FABRICATION USING STITCHING LITHOGRAPHY IN A STATE OF THE ART CMOS FOUNDRY AND DEMONSTRATE ITS FUNCTIONALITY ON PACKAGED PROTOTYPES.

GAN HAS DIRECT BENEFITS SUCH AS HIGHER POWER DENSITY, REDUCED FOOTPRINT, INCREASED POWER CAPACITY, AND IMPROVED POWER EFFICIENCY. INCREASING FREQUENCY OF OPERATION RESULTS IN SMALLER COMPONENTS BUT IT ALSO CREATES A CHALLENGE FOR THERMAL MANAGEMENT AND MAGNETIC COMPONENT DESIGN. SET GROUP WILL DEVELOP A NOVEL THERMAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM UTILIZING ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING WHICH WILL CONSOLIDATE THE HOUSING AND COOLING IN A SINGLE PART. SIMILARLY, SET GROUP WILL DESIGN A NOVEL TRANSFORMER THAT WILL INTEGRATE THE RESONANT INDUCTOR, TRANSFORMER, AND OUTPUT VOLTAGE MULTIPLIER STAGE INTO A SINGLE UNIT.

PROPOSALS WERE RECEIVED AND EVALUATED AND SELECTIONS OF SUCCESSFUL PROPOSALS ANNOUNCED OCTOBER 5, 2018. NASA ISSUED THIS SOLICITATION TO SOLICIT IDEAS AND TECHNOLOGIES TO ADVANCE TRASH COMPACTION AND PROCESSING (TCPS) CAPABILITIES. TRASH PROCESSING ENABLES REDUCTION IN MASS, VOLUME, AND THE CREW TIME DEDICATED TO LOGISTICS MANAGEMENT. THE CURRENT APPROACH TO TRASH MANAGEMENT ENTAILS MANUALLY COMPACTING, TEMPORARILY STORING IT, AND THEN DISPOSING OF THE TRASH EITHER BY RETURN TO EARTH OR INCINERATION DURING REENTRY IN A DISPOSABLE SUPPLY VEHICLE. LONG DISTANCES FROM EARTH AND LENGTHY DURATIONS WITH LIMITED OR NO RESUPPLY WILL CHARACTERIZE FUTURE HUMAN MISSIONS. RETURNING TRASH TO EARTH WILL BE IMPRACTICAL, JETTISONING DURING THE MISSION CAN RESULT IN LOSS OF VALUABLE RECOVERABLE RESOURCES AND DISPOSING OF IT LOCALLY MAY POSE A PLANETARY PROTECTION RISK, IF LEFT UNTREATED..NASA NEEDS A SYSTEM THAT CAN HANDLE ASTRONAUT TRASH IN SITU RATHER THAN DISPOSING OF IT OVERBOARD. HOWEVER, STORING TRASH INSIDE A SPACECRAFT CREATES PHYSICAL AND BIOLOGICAL HAZARDS FOR THE CREW, CONSUMES CRITICAL HABITAT VOLUME, AND SEQUESTERS POTENTIALLY VALUABLE RESOURCES. THIS WAS ONE OF THE SUCCESSFUL PROPOSALS FOR RESEARCH CONTRACTS IN AREAS FOR DESIGN, FABRICATION, AND TESTING OF CRITICAL COMPONENTS FOR A TCPS THAT COMPACTS TRASH TO REDUCE STORAGE VOLUME, RENDERS IT BIOLOGICALLY AND PHYSICALLY SAFE AND STABLE, RECOVERS TRAPPED RESOURCES, AND FORMS RESIDUAL MATERIAL INTO A STORABLE, POTENTIALLY USEFUL PRODUCT."

THIS CONTRACT INVOLVES DEVELOPMENT AND DEMONSTRATION OF A HYBRID LIFE SUPPORT SYSTEMS (HLSS) THAT WILL ENABLE OPERATIONALLY EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE EXPLORATION ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROL AND LIFE SUPPORT SYSTEMS THROUGH HYBRID TECHNOLOGIES THAT CAN BE EVOLVED TO MEET LONG-DURATION LIFE SUPPORT REQUIREMENTS FOR SUSTAINED HABITATION AT MUCH LOWER LIFE CYCLE COSTS.  CURRENT STATE-OF-THE-ART TECHNOLOGY BEING FLOWN ON THE ISS ALLOWS FOR ONLY 25-50 PERCENT RESOURCE RECOVERY DEPENDING UPON THE RESOURCE IN QUESTION, WHETHER OXYGEN, WATER, OR CARBON.  STRATEGICALLY AND OPERATIONALLY VALUABLE BIOREGENERATIVE CAPABILITY THAT COMBINES WATER RECYCLING, AIR REVITALIZATION, FOOD AUGMENTATION AND RADIATION PROTECTION INCREASES TOTAL SYSTEM CLOSURE TO AN ESTIMATED 50-85 PERCENT RESOURCE RECOVERY, AND DECREASES THE TOTAL MISSION MASS AND THEREBY COST-EFFECTIVELY EXTENDING SUSTAINABLE LONG-DURATION HUMAN MISSIONS. THE HLSS INTEGRATES NOMINAL PIC LIFE SUPPORT FOR TRANSITIONAL SHORT DURATIONS AUGMENTED WITH BIOLOGICALLY BASED LIFE SUPPORT TO EXTEND MISSION DURATIONS TO YEARS WITH MINIMAL RESUPPLY. THE SMALLER PHYSICAVCHEMICAL SYSTEM ALSO PROVIDES BACKUP AND SAFE HAVEN CAPABILITIES. ORBITEC PROPOSES A STEPWISE DEMONSTRATION OF THE HLSS THAT RAPIDLY EVOLVES CURRENT SYSTEMS AND CAPABILITIES INTO LONG DURATION LIFE SUPPORT APPLICABLE TO SEVERAL EXPLORATION SUPPORT MODULE CONFIGURATIONS:   PHASE I GROUND DEVELOPMENT, COMPONENT, SUBSYSTEM, AND SUB SCALE SYSTEMS   PHASE IT ISS AND LEO SORTIE TESTS, SUBSYSTEM, SUBSCALE SYSTEM TESTING   PHASE GROUND-BASED HLSS TEST BED, FULL SCALE INTEGRATED TESTING   PHASE N LEO AND/OR CISLUNAR TEST BEDS   PHASE V DEEP SPACE FULL SCALE DEMONSTRATORTHE HLSS INTEGRATES ESTABLISHED PHYSICAVCHEMICAL (PIC) LIFE SUPPORT COMPONENTS AS A BASE CAPABILITY WITH BIOPRODUCTION (BID) SYSTEMS FOR WATER AND ATMOSPHERE PROCESSING AND FOOD AUGMENTATION, BRINGING REDUCTIONS IN TOTAL MASS LAUNCHED FOR LONG-DURATION MISSIONS. THE BIO SYSTEM ENABLES A SMALLER PIC SYSTEM AND PROVIDES RESUPPLY SAVINGS THAT HAVE COST SAVINGS ADVANTAGES FOR ANY SUSTAINED HUMAN OPERATION THAT IS GREATER THAN ONE YEAR, -MAKING THE HLSS RELEVANT FOR CONTINUOUS LEO OPERATIONS, CISLUNAR AND MARS TRANSIT MISSIONS IN ADDITION TO PLANETARY SURFACE OR DEEP SPACE MISSIONS. THE IMPROVED COST EFFECTIVENESS WOULD BE GREATLY ATTRACTIVE TO COMMERCIAL PROVIDERS TO LEO AND OTHER DESTINATIONS. THIS INITIAL EFFORT WILL FULLY ASSESS THE OPTIONS, PERFORMANCE, AND RELIABILITY OF HLSS FOR VARIOUS MISSION SCENARIOS BASED ON PRIOR GROUND-BASED TESTING AND CURRENT BIOLOGICAL FLIGHT SYSTEMS INCLUDING VEGGIE, THE FIRST FOOD PRODUCTION SYSTEM TO BE DEMONSTRATED ON ISS. IN THE NEAR TERM, HLSS WOULD RESULT IN FOOD AUGMENTATION, PROVIDING FRESH FOOD FOR HEALTH AND PSYCHOLOGICAL BENEFITS, AND INCREASED WATER RECYCLING AND ATMOSPHERE REVITALIZATION, OFF-LOADING DEMANDS ON A SMALLER PIC SYSTEM, ULTIMATELY REDUCING POWER, MASS, AND MAINTENANCE NEEDS.  CONCEPTS OF HLSS OPERATION WILL BE DEFINED FOR CANDIDATE EXPLORATION AUGMENTATION MODULES AND FOR VARIOUS MISSION CLASSES, AND USED TO CONDUCT TRADE ANALYSES USING AN IN-HOUSE MODELING PROGRAM THAT ALLOWS PIC AND BID LIFE SUPPORT SUBSYSTEMS AND COMPONENTS TO BE ANALYZED AS PART OF AN INTEGRATED LIFE SUPPORT SYSTEM. ACTIVITIES WILL INCLUDE A DEMONSTRATION OF EXPANDED BIOPRODUCTION FLIGHT SYSTEMS WITHIN ORBITEC''S EXISTING CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENT FACILITIES."

INDIVIDUAL SIGNALS FROM EACH DEVICE ARE ROUTED VIA THE SUBSTRATE WITHIN THE CHIP, WHICH ALSO INCLUDES DECOUPLING CAPACITORS AND PULL-UP RESISTORS IN THE SIP. THIS OPTIMIZES THE NUMBER OF USEFUL PINS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO THE SYSTEM DESIGNER. THE SIP DESIGN OPTIMIZES THE SIZE, USER SIMPLICITY AND RELIABILITY OF THE SOLUTION. USING THIS SIP SOLUTION RATHER THAN THREE DISCRETELY PACKAGED PARTS MEANS THAT THE AREA OF THE FUNCTIONALITY CAN BE REDUCED BY APPROXIMATELY A FACTOR OF FIVE AND THE NUMBER OF PIN INTERCONNECTIONS ON A PCB CAN BE REDUCED BY A FACTOR OF MORE THAN THREE. IN PHASE II, WE PROPOSE TO BUILD 85 UNITS OF THE DEVICE AND QUALIFY IT. IN ADDITION, WE WILL BUILD EVALUATION BOARDS AND A SOFTWARE BOARD SUPPORT PACKAGE SO THAT THE DEVICE CAN BE EASILY EVALUATED AND USED FOR DEVELOPMENT WORK BY NASA ENGINEERS. OUR OBJECTIVE IS TO GET AS MANY UNITS / EVALUATION BOARDS ONTO NASA ENGINEERS DESKS AS POSSIBLE.

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

THESE IONOGRAMS WERE RECORDED IN CANADA AND ARE FROM HIGH POLAR LATITUDES AND SPAN 8 LARGE GEOMAGNETIC STORMS.  EACH STORM PERIOD INCLUDES ONE OR TWO QUIET DAYS PRIOR TO OR IN THE RECOVERY PHASE OF THE STORM.  THE TOPSIDE EDP''S WILL PROVIDE UNIQUE EVIDENCE ON HOW M-I COUPLING RESPONDS DURING MAJOR GEOMAGNETIC STORMS.  A BROAD COMMUNITY OF BOTH MAGNETOSPHERIC AND IONOSPHERIC RESEARCHERS WILL HAVE ACCESS TO GROUND TRUTH STORM DYNAMICS THAT IS NOT CURRENTLY AVAILABLE.  DURING THE PRIOR DEVELOPMENT OF THE TOPSIDE INVERSION TECHNIQUES, ANOMALOUS PROFILES WERE DETECTED THAT MAY PROVIDE THE COMMUNITY WITH THE PROMISING STORM-TIME RESEARCH FOCUS.  THIS EFFORT WILL LEVERAGE THESE NEWLY DEVELOPED FILM RECOVERY PROCEDURES TO SIGNIFICANTLY EXPAND THE TOPSIDE SOUNDER EDP DATA BASE ARCHIVED AT THE SDPF.  IN ADDITION, IT WILL ENABLE THE ANALYSIS OF OBSERVATIONS TAKEN DURING THE 8 LARGE GEOMAGNETIC STORMS."

AIRWORTHINESS CERTIFICATION BY THE FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION (FAA) IS A CRITICAL STEP TOWARDS NAS INTEGRATION. TO MATCH THE EXPECTED FAA SAFETY AND RELIABILITY STANDARDS FOR UAS CERTIFICATION, NOVEL TECHNOLOGIES ARE NEEDED. CONVENTIONAL MANNED AIR VEHICLES MEET FAA STANDARDS VIA HARDWARE REDUNDANCY, AN OPTION UNAVAILABLE FOR UAS DUE TO SIZE, WEIGHT, AND POWER CONSTRAINTS. THIS CHALLENGE WAS ADDRESSED IN PHASE I VIA THE SO-CALLED ALGORITHMICALLY REDUNDANT APPROACH, WHERE MULTIPLE FAULT DETECTION AND ISOLATION ALGORITHMS WORK IN PARALLEL TO DETECT FAULTS MORE RELIABLY. USING FAA-APPROVED PROCEDURES LIKE FAULT TREE ANALYSIS OR FAILURE MODES AND EFFECTS ANALYSIS, RELIABILITY OF ALGORITHMICALLY REDUNDANT SYSTEMS IS COMPUTED. THIS APPROACH WILL BE EXTENDED IN PHASE II TO INCLUDE FLIGHT CONTROL SYSTEM HARDWARE AND CONTROL LAWS IN THE LOOP, AND WILL INVOLVE VALIDATION VIA FLIGHT TESTING. A COMPREHENSIVE METHODOLOGY AND ACCOMPANYING SOFTWARE TOOLBOX WILL RESULT: STI APPROACH FOR FAULT ESTIMATION AND RELIABILITY FOR UAS (SAFER-UAS).

      "description": "IGF::OT::IGFTECHSHOT''S INNOVATIVE 3D METAL PRINTER OFFERS THE UNIQUE ABILITY TO FABRICATE METAL COMPONENTS AND TOOLS IN SPACE WHICH CAN BE UTILIZED FOR SUSTAINABILITY, MAINTENANCE AND RESEARCH. THE PROPOSED SYSTEM WILL ACCOMPLISH THIS TASK THROUGH THE UTILIZATION OF A TWOSTAGE FILAMENT MELTING PROCESS WHEREBY A METALLIC FILAMENT IS FIRST HEATED TO CURIE TEMPERATURE THROUGH INDUCTION AND THEN DEPOSITED ON A BUILD PLATFORM WHERE IT IS FUSED TO THE PREVIOUS LAYER BY EXPOSURE TO A LOW ENERGY LASER. THIS NEW UNIQUE PROCESS IS KNOWN AS SINTERED METAL PRINTING WITH LASER EXPOSURE (SIMPLE).INDUCTION HEATING IS NOT ENTIRELY NEW TO FUSED DEPOSITION MANUFACTURING (FDM). THERE HAS BEEN RECENT RESEARCH INTO THE INTEGRATION OF AN INDUCTION COIL INTO THE \\HOT END\\\" OF A PLASTIC FILAMENT FDM PRINTER. THE INDUCTION COIL SURROUNDS THE METAL NOZZLE, KNOWN AS THE \\\"HOT END\\\" AND INDUCTIVELY HEATS THE NOZZLE WHEN AN AC CURRENT IS APPLIED. THE NOZZLE THEN HEATS AND MELTS THE PLASTIC FILAMENT ALLOWING IT TO BE EXTRUDED ONTO A PLATFORM WHERE A PART IS FORMED. THE USE OF INDUCTION HEATING, WHEN PRINTING WITH A METAL FILAMENT, IS SIMILAR BUT THE INDUCTION COIL HEATS THE WIRE FILAMENT DIRECTLY AS IT PASSES THROUGH ITS CENTER.

(TUI) PROPOSES TO DEVELOP THE METAL ADVANCED MANUFACTURING BOT-ASSISTED ASSEMBLY (MAMBA) PROCESS, A ROBOTICALLY MANAGED METAL PRESS AND MILLING SYSTEM USED TO CREATE PRECISION PARTS ON ORBIT. THIS MANUFACTURING PROCESS PROVIDES AN ALTERNATIVE TO 3D PRINTING METALS IN SPACE, WHICH IS DIFFICULT DUE TO SPACE ENVIRONMENT, FEEDSTOCK SAFETY CONCERNS, AND PRINT QUALITY ISSUES. INSTEAD, THE MAMBA-PROCESS RELIES ON AN INGOT FORMING TECHNOLOGY TO CREATE A METAL INGOT. THIS INGOT CAN THEN BE MILLED AND MACHINED TO FORM A PRECISION PART USING A STANDARD CNC MILLING TECHNIQUE. IN ORDER TO MINIMIZE ASTRONAUT TIME AND EXPOSURE TO THE PROCESS, THE MAMBA-PROCESS WILL BE HIGHLY AUTOMATED AND OUTFITTED WITH A ROBOTIC ASSISTANT, CAPABLE OF REMOVING THE INGOT FROM THE PRESS AND PLACING THE INGOT IN THE MILL. AUTOMATED TOOL CHANGES ARE ALSO POSSIBLE FOR THE MILL, ENABLING COMPLEX SHAPES WITH FINE EDGE FINISHES. TESTING OF THE PROCESS TECHNOLOGIES LED TO A LAB DEMONSTRATION OF INGOT FORMATION AND MILLING IN THE PHASE I EFFORT, MATURING THE MAMBA PROCESS TO TRL-3. IN THE PHASE II EFFORT, A FULL SCALE ENGINEERING UNIT WILL BE BUILT AND TESTED, MATURING THE VARIOUS THE PAYLOAD SUBSYSTEMS TO TRL-5 AND PREPARING THE WORK NEEDED TO VALIDATE THIS TECHNOLOGY FOR FLIGHT."

EXPAND AN AUGMENTED REALITY (AR) USER INTERFACE FOR THESE ULTRASOUND METHODS THAT PROVIDES PROCEDURAL GUIDANCE IN ACQUIRING AND INITIALLY DIAGNOSING SONOGRAPHIC DATA FOR ULTRASOUND PROCEDURES TO ENHANCED DEGREE OF PROCEDURAL COMPETENCY. 3.) DEVELOP AND TEST THE INTEGRATION OF MAGNETIC-BASED VOLUME NAVIGATION, AND COMPLEMENTARY DIMENSIONAL REFERENCING TECHNOLOGIES, ON THE FUS PLATFORM TO ALLOW FOR 3-DIMENSIONAL ULTRASOUND PROCEDURAL GUIDANCE THROUGH THE HEAD MOUNTED DISPLAY. 4.) INTEGRATE THE CURRENT SYSTEM WITH PROCEDURAL GUIDANCE RESOURCES SUCH AS ELECTRONIC PROCEDURES (EPROC) AND EXISTING ULTRASOUND TRAINING MATERIALS. 5.)

NASA S HUMANOID ROBOTS HAVE HIGHLY DEXTEROUS END-EFFECTORS, BUT DEVELOPING SOFTWARE TO FULLY UTILIZE SUCH HANDS REMAINS A CHALLENGING TASK. GRASPING STRATEGIES ARE HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON OBJECT MODELS AND LOCALIZATION. ENVIRONMENTAL OBSTACLES OR THE OBJECT''S INTENDED USE CAN STRONGLY INFLUENCE HOW BEST TO GRASP IT. PREVIOUSLY WITH NASA, TRACLABS DEVELOPED CRAFTSMAN, WHICH SUPPORTS ROBOT-INDEPENDENT TASK DESCRIPTIONS, ALTHOUGH GRASP STRATEGIES ARE ROBOT-SPECIFIC. HERE, WE EXTEND CRAFTSMAN TO HANDLE GRASPING AS A TASK-INFORMED BEHAVIOR. THIS NEW SYSTEM, CALLED ADAMANT, WILL CONNECT TO OTHER CRAFTSMAN SOFTWARE NODES TO HELP FIND THE BEST OPTION FOR ACQUIRING AN OBJECT. THE RESULT WILL BE A ROBOT GRASPING INTERFACE THAT PRODUCES MORE ROBUST ROBOT BEHAVIORS WHILE REDUCING THE COGNITIVE LOAD ON REMOTE ROBOT OPERATORS. THE ADAMANT SYSTEM USES SENSOR AND/OR MODEL DATA IN ADDITION TO A TASK DESCRIPTION TO DEVELOP A RANKED LIST OF POTENTIAL GRASPS FOR AN OBJECT, USING USER-SELECTED GRASP METRICS. THESE DIFFERENT GRASPS ARE EXPLORED IN THE CONTEXT OF THE COMPLETE TASK TO ARRIVE AT THE STRATEGY MOST LIKELY TO SUCCEED. IN PHASE I, WE DEMONSTRATED THAT WE COULD DESCRIBE TASKS IN TERMS OF THE EFFECT ON THE OBJECT, RATHER THAN JUST A SEQUENCE OF WAYPOINTS FOR A MANIPULATOR AND GRIPPER. IN PHASE II, WE WILL FULLY INCORPORATE THIS OBJECT-CENTRIC IDEA INTO CRAFTSMAN, ALLOWING THE USER TO DEFINE TASKS WITHOUT A SPECIFIC MANIPULATOR/GRIPPER IN MIND. THE ADAMANT SYSTEM WILL AUTOMATICALLY FIGURE OUT AT RUN-TIME THE BEST WAY TO GRASP AN OBJECT GIVEN MODELS OF THE HAND AND MODELS (OR SENSOR DATA) OF THE OBJECT.

      "description": "IGF::OT::IGFCURRENT NASA MISSIONS TO THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION (ISS) ARE HEAVILY DEPENDENT UPON GROUND CONTROLLERS TO ASSIST CREW MEMBERS IN PERFORMING ROUTINE OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE AS WELL AS RESPONSES TO OFF-NOMINAL SITUATIONS. PERFORMING THESE PROCEDURES OFTEN REQUIRES CLOSE COLLABORATION BETWEEN GROUND CONTROLLERS WHO HAVE DEEP KNOWLEDGE OF THE SPACECRAFT''S SYSTEMS. THIS COLLABORATION BECOMES MORE DIFFICULT IN EXTENDED MISSIONS AND CREW MEMBERS WILL NEED TO HAVE MORE AUTONOMY. AUGMENTED AND VIRTUAL REALITY TECHNOLOGY CAN HELP REPLACE SOME OF THE GUIDANCE THAT GROUND CONTROLLERS OFFER TO CREW MEMBERS DURING PROCEDURE EXECUTION. OUR PROPOSED APPROACH FOCUSES ON INTEGRATING AUGMENTED AND VIRTUAL REALITY TECHNOLOGIES INTO THE SAME TOOLS THAT MISSION OPERATIONS USES TODAY, ALLOWING FOR AUGMENTED AND VIRTUAL REALITY ASSISTANCE TO BE BUILT AND UPDATED BY FLIGHT CONTROLLERS AND OTHER MISSION SPECIALISTS JUST AS THEY DO FOR THEIR OTHER WORK PRODUCTS. IN PHASE I, TRACLABS INTEGRATED ITS PRIDE ELECTRONIC PROCEDURE PLATFORM WITH AUGMENTED AND VIRTUAL REALITY SYSTEMS SUCH AS THE HTC VIVE. IN PHASE II WE WILL EXTEND THE PRIDE PLATFORM TO AUGMENTED REALITY DEVICES SUCH AS THE MICROSOFT HOLOLENS. TRACLABS IS ALSO PARTNERED WITH THE GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY''S AUGMENTED ENVIRONMENTS LABORATORY WHO WILL DEVELOP ALGORITHMS THAT DYNAMICALLY ADJUST THE AUGMENTED REALITY CUES (BOTH THEIR POSITION, ORIENTATION, AND SCALE, ALONG WITH THE SPECIFIC GRAPHICAL ELEMENTS USED) SUCH THAT THEY ALIGN WITH THE NECESSARY PARTS OF THE WORLD WITHOUT OBSCURING IMPORTANT PARTS OF THE WORLD."

CONSEQUENTLY, SIGNIFICANT PROPELLANT MASS WILL BE REQUIRED. WHILE IT IS TECHNICALLY FEASIBLE TO GENERATE O2 AND CO PROPELLANTS BY ELECTROLYSIS OF CO2 FROM THE MARTIAN ATMOSPHERE, IT WILL ONLY WORK ON BODIES WHERE THERE IS SIGNIFICANT CO2 IN THE ATMOSPHERE, AND THE MASS OF THE REQUIRED INFRASTRUCTURE (ELECTROLYZER, BATTERIES, SOLAR PANELS) IS SUBSTANTIAL. A RECENT STUDY SHOWED THAT A HYBRID ROCKET WITH MULTI-START CAPABILITY TRADES MORE FAVORABLY THAN EITHER A CO2 ELECTROLYSIS SYSTEM OR A BIPROPELLANT SYSTEM WHERE THE PROPELLANTS ARE GENERATED ON EARTH. USING A HIGH-PERFORMANCE HYBRID PROPELLANT COMBINATION AND BEING ABLE TO RESTART THE HYBRID ROCKET ARE THE KEYS. IN PREVIOUS AND ONGOING WORK, ULTRAMET HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT ELECTRICALLY HEATED OPEN-CELL SILICON CARBIDE FOAM CAN BE USED AS AN IGNITER FOR BOTH MONOPROPELLANT AND BIPROPELLANT ROCKET ENGINES. DUE TO ITS LOW MASS, EXCELLENT OXIDATION RESISTANCE, AND FAVORABLE ELECTRICAL CHARACTERISTICS, THE FOAM CAN BE HEATED TO 1300 C IN JUST SECONDS, WHICH ENABLES IT TO QUICKLY IGNITE ANY PROPELLANT FLOWING THROUGH IT. THE PHASE I PROJECT DEMONSTRATED THAT A FOAM HEATER COULD BE TURNED ON AND OFF ANY NUMBER OF TIMES AND THAT IT WAS CAPABLE OF HEATING OXYGEN AND IGNITING PARAFFIN. APPLIED TO A PORTION OF THE OXIDIZER STREAM IN A HYBRID ROCKET ENGINE, THIS WILL PROVIDE MULTI-START CAPABILITY. IN PHASE II, ULTRAMET WILL TEAM WITH PARABILIS SPACE TECHNOLOGIES TO DESIGN, FABRICATE, AND TEST A HYBRID ROCKET IGNITION SYSTEM SUITABLE FOR USE WITH O2, NTO, OR MON-25 ON A MARS ASCENT VEHICLE."

THE VECTOR-R IS A 2-STAGE PRESSURE-FED, LOX/SUBCOOLED PROPYLENE COMMERCIAL SMALL LAUNCH VEHICLE, DESIGNED TO PLACE UP TO 60 KG IN LOW EARTH ORBIT. ELECTRICALLY-DRIVEN MICROPUMPS DRIVE A SMALL PORTION OF EACH PROPELLANT OVER A NOVEL 3D-PRINTED HEAT EXCHANGER AT THE ENGINE TO PRESSURIZE THE TANKS. EXCESS FLOW CAN BE DIVERTED TO THE ENGINE AS NEEDED. THIS APPROACH REDUCES SYSTEM MASS, COMPLEXITY AND ACQUISITION COST AS WELL AS OPERATIONAL COSTS. IT ELIMINATES THE NEED FOR ALL HIGH-PRESSURE TANKS AND ASSOCIATED COMPONENTS. IT CAN BE USED ON ANY PRESSURE-FED STAGE, FOR LAUNCH VEHICLE AND IN-SPACE APPLICATION WHEN USING HIGH VAPOR PRESSURE PROPELLANTS SUCH AS LOX/METHANE OR LOX/PROPANE. AS SUCH, IT IS AN ENABLER FOR MISSIONS TARGETED TO USE IN-SITU PROPELLANTS SINCE THE NEED FOR A SEPARATE PRESSURANT LIKE HELIUM IS EITHER GREATLY REDUCED OR ELIMINATED. BY LEVERAGING VECTOR S ONGOING COMMERCIALLY-FUNDED VECTOR-R MICRO-LAUNCHER DEVELOPMENT, IT IS POSSIBLE TO REACH TRL 6-READY SYSTEM DURING PHASE II AND TRANSITION TO THE VECTOR-R OPERATIONS (TRL-9) SOON AFTER."

SIMILAR VALVES DESIGNED BY WASK ENGINEERING HAVE OPERATED FOR MORE THAN 2X109 CYCLES WHILE MAINTAINING A LEAKAGE RATE OF LESS THAN 1X10-3 SCCM OF HE. THE CURRENT VALVE DESIGN IS CONFIGURED TO OPERATE WITH CRYOGENIC PROPELLANTS AND SUPPORT THE FLOW RATES REQURIED FOR A 100 LBF LIQUID OXYGEN/LIQUID METHANE THRUSTER. A PIEZO ACTUATED VALVE HAS MANY BENEFITS FOR RCS THRUSTERS. THE SPEED WITH WHICH THE VALVE CAN ADJUST ITS THROTTLE POSITION MEANS THAT WITH TWO SUCH VALVES THE THRUSTER PROPELLANT MIXTURE RATIO CAN BE RAPIDLY ADJUSTED TO PREVENT HARDWARE DAMAGE. THE VALVES HAVE THE ABILITY TO CONTINUOUSLY THROTTLE OVER A RANGE OF THRUST LEVELS, ALLOWING THE THRUSTER TO OPERATE FROM ZERO TO FULL THRUST. THE PIEZO CRYSTALS USE VERY LITTLE POWER, REDUCING THE OVERALL POWER CONSUMPTION, AGAIN REDUCING WEIGHT."

THE REQUIREMENT TO ADVANCE TOWARDS MORE FUEL EFFICIENT AND ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY AIRCRAFTS DEMANDS BATTERY SYSTEMS THAT CAN OPERATE FOR LONGER PERIODS OF TIME IN A SAFER AND MORE RELIABLE MANNER. AN ATTRACTIVE TECHNIQUE THAT CAN BE USED TO INCREASE BATTERY PACK LIFE IS THAT OF ACTIVE BALANCING. ACTIVE BALANCING IS TYPICALLY USED TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF ENERGY PUT INTO OR EXTRACTED OUT OF A BATTERY. IF PERFORMED EFFICIENTLY AND ACCURATELY, ACTIVE BALANCING CAN TRANSLATE INTO LONGER BATTERY LIFE AND MORE EFFICIENT BATTERY UTILIZATION. ACTIVE BALANCERS PRESENTLY EQUALIZE EITHER VOLTAGE OR STATE OF CHARGE (SOC) IN A GROUP OF CELLS OR SUPER-CELLS IN SERIES. THE MORE ACCURATE IN-OPERANDO SOC ACTIVE BALANCERS DEPEND ON ON-LINE SOC ESTIMATION ALGORITHMS THAT ARE TYPICALLY BASED ON TERMINAL VOLTAGE, CURRENT, AND TEMPERATURE. THESE ALGORITHMS (E.G., COULOMB COUNTING, KALMAN-BASED FILTER ESTIMATION, ETC) ACCUMULATE ERRORS AND/OR BECOME UNSTABLE AS A CONSEQUENCE OF MEASUREMENT ERRORS, MODEL SIMPLIFICATIONS, AND THE LACK OF AN ACCURATE BATTERY PARAMETER DETERMINATION AND TRACKING METHOD, WHICH IS CRITICAL AS THE BATTERY AGES AND/OR OPERATES UNDER UNFORESEEN CONDITIONS. TO ASSIST WITH THIS PROBLEM WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP AN ACTIVE BALANCING ELECTRONIC SYSTEM THAT CAN JOINTLY BALANCE THE BATTERY PACK AND MEASURE BATTERY HEALTH RELATED PARAMETERS WITHOUT ADDITIONAL HARDWARE.

ALL THREE UNSTEADY AERODYNAMIC SUB-SYSTEMS CAN BE OBTAINED BY APPLYING THE EXTENDED COMPLEX VARIABLE DIFFERENTIATION (CVD) TECHNIQUE TO THE COMPLEX VERSION OF FUN3D, REFERRED TO AS FUN3D-CVD, TO GENERATE THE NUMERICALLY EXACT LINEARIZED UNSTEADY AERODYNAMIC FORCES.

THE PROPOSED WORK WILL OFFER A COMPUTATIONAL TOOL TO THE NASA DESIGNERS FOR EARLY EXPLORATION OF DESIGN CONCEPTS THAT EXPLOIT THE TRADE-OFF BETWEEN THE PASSIVE AND ACTIVE APPROACHES FOR MITIGATING THE POTENTIAL AEROELASTIC PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH THOSE CONFIGURATIONS. ..THE PROPOSED DISCRETE TIME STATE-SPACE PLANT MODEL GENERATION CAN BE APPLIED TO VARIOUS FLIGHT VEHICLES INCLUDING BLENDED WING-BODIES, JOINED WINGS, SUB/SUPERSONIC TRANSPORTS, MORPHING AIRCRAFT, AND SIMILAR REVOLUTIONARY CONCEPTS BEING PURSUED.
